Select the notebook titled 'student_notebook_light_conditions.ipynb' and click 'Duplicate'.\n2.    Confirm with Duplicate when asked if you are certain that you want to duplicate the notebook.\n3.    A copy of the notebook has appeared with the suffix '-Copy' and a number. Explore the anatomy of the notebook (https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/fair-bio-practice/blob/gh-pages/fig/10-02-jupyter_anatomy.png)\n4.    Change the title of the notebook from -copy number to your initials e.g. “student_notebook_light_conditions_IB”\n5.    Save the notebook: Click on the disk symbol in the toolbar\n6.    Run the notebook: Select the top cell of the notebook with the title (this is likely pre-selected already and will show with a light-blue bar to its left), and click “Run” in the tool bar.\n7.    Click two times. What can you see?\n-\n-\n-\n-\n8.    We want to run ALL the code: In the top tool bar click Cell > Run All. What can you see?\n-\n-\n-\n-\n \n DONE: \n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n* Exercise 2: How to add and remove content\nYou have duplicated a notebook and saved it under your own name. Now we will add text, remove cells and change code.\n \n1.     Change the author name of the document to your name: Double click on the cell containing the author name and change the name.\n2.     Press Run again.\n3.     Add a new cell: Let us add details about the “light_results.txt” file that is loaded. The “+” in the tool bar creates new cells below the currently selected cell. Thus select the cell above the code and click “+” in the toolbar.\n4.     Ensure the type of the cell is Markdown and enter a description of subsequent analysis e.g.: “Loading of results following short- and long-day light exposure on arabidopsis, followed by visualisation of differences in chlorophyll/biomas etc... content between genotypes on short-days and long-days.”\n5.     Press Run again.\n6.     To remove a cell, select the cell you have just created and click on the scissors icon in the toolbar. (This can be undone under Edit > Undo Delete Cells)\n7.     Change colours of your graph: Where the code of the graph reads the comment “# change colour of groups” you can replace the HEX codes, # followed by 6-symbol code, with names of colours (e.g. blue, green…) or other HEX codes if you are familiar with them.\n8.     Save graph under new name: Add your initials to the file name under which the image is saved. Press Run. Your image should be visible in overall file hierarchy.\n \nDONE:\n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n*Exercise 3: Add another analysis step\nWe have shown you how to manipulate text and code in Jupyter notebooks. You should be able to add data visualisation (a graph) and stats for long-day light condition including annotations yourself.\n \n1.     Add additional cells including\na.     Titles\nb.     Edited code to depict graph from long-days (saved under different name)\nc.     Figure legend\nd.     Statistical testing of difference between genotypes on long-days (remember to assign a different variable throughout e.g. LD.aov)\ne.     Interpretation of results of statistical testing\n\nDONE:\n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n*Exercise 4: Sharing of your Jupyter Notebook\nYou have now generated your own analysis and interpretation on top of your collaborators results and want to share this with your colleagues.\n \n1.     Download your Notebook (ensure all code has been run) as .html and .pdf\n2.    View the documents and think about why it is important to run all code before download (try Cell > All Output > Clear and download your Notebook, compare the outputs)\n \nQuestions:\nWhat is the difference between running all code and clearing all run code?\n-\n-\n-\n \nWhy is it important to run all code before download?\n-\n-\n-\n \nDONE:\n\n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n*Exercise For Advanced\n\nFInd a way to plot in sensible way: both conditions LD and SD on the same graph, for the 3 genotypes and two output variables (biomas, starch).\n\nIf you created advanced plots type your name bellow:\n-\n-\n-\n\nYou can try to create the same plots in python (but we cannot guarantee all the packages are installed)\n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n*Exercise 5: Accessibility of Jupyter Notebooks\nOn a scale from -2 to 2, how do you feel about the following statements (R is interchangeable with Python), \nwhere -2 (strongly disagree), 0 no opinion to +2 strongly agree:\n \nType a number between -2 to 2 behind the statement:\n*making graphs for a subset of data is easier in R than in Excel:\n*it is easier to filter for data in R than in Excel:\n*it is easier to generate a series of plots with similar layout in R than Excel:\n*it is easier to do large scale data processing in R than in Excel:\n*using notebooks does not require any programming knowledge:\n*notebooks give you a better overview of your data analysis than Excel:\n*notebooks links laboratory style records with data analysis\n*Jupyter is free, whilst a Microsoft Office (+Excel) suite costs $149.99, this alone is an incentive to use Jupyter:\n*you need to learn R to do any data processing in notebooks:\n*notebooks assures reproducible computing:\n\nDONE:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n*Lesson 11: Version Control\n\n*Exercise 1: Problems with a change\nWhich of these issues can you relate to? (Type +1 next to each statement if you relate to it)\n*I have fifteen versions of this file - which one do I use?\n*I can’t remake this figure from last year\n*I slightly modified my code in one place, everything stopped working\n*I have several copies of the same directory because I'm worried about breaking something\n*Somebody added erroneous records in a shared file with samples, cannot find who and why\n*You remember seeing a data file but cannot find it anymore: is it deleted? Moved away?\n*I tried multiple analysis and I don't remember which one I chose to generate my output data\n*I have to merge changes to our manuscript from 10 different emails with collaborators\n*I accidentally deleted a part of my work\n*I came to an old project and forgot where I left/saved it\n*I reorganized my data files, but broke the analysis pipeline and don't know how to fix it\n*I have trouble to find the source of a mistake in an experiment\n*My directory is polluted with a lot of unused/temporary/old folders because I'm afraid of losing something important\n*I made a lot of changes to my paper but want to bring back one paragraph\n \nDONE:\n\n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n*Exercise 2: Manual Versioning\nWhich of these issues does manual versioning help to tackle?\n(Type +1 next to each statement if manual versioning helps to tackle)\n \n*I have fifteen versions of this file and I don't know which one to use\n*I can't remake this figure from last year\n*I slightly modified my code in one place, everything stopped working\n*I have several copies of the same directory because I'm worried about breaking something\n*Somebody added erroneous records in a shared file with samples, I cannot find who and why\n*I tried multiple analysis and I don't remember which one I chose to generate my output data\n*I have to merge changes to our manuscript from 10 different emails from collaborators\n*I made a lot of changes to my paper but want to bring back one paragraph\n \nDONE:\n \n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n*Exercise 3: Changelog in action\nHave a look at one of the example Github repositories and how they track changes*:\n\nGreen and Blue:\n*data from E.R. Ballou et al. 2020\n*https://github.com/ewallace/pseudonuclease_evolution_2020/commits/master\n\nGive examples of:\n*what makes them a good changelog\n*what could be improved\nThink which are the most difficult features to replicate with manual version control?\n-\n-\n-\n\nRed and Organge:\n*data from I. Boehm et al. 2020\n*https://github.com/BioRDM/nmj-pig/commits/main\n\nGive examples of:\n*what makes them a good changelog\n*what could be improved\nThink which are the most difficult features to replicate with manual version control?\n -\n -\n -\n \n DONE:\n \n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n*Exercise 4:\nFive reasons to use a version control system in research, give +1 to the two most important for you\n  \n*Tell the story: The history of your commit messages will describe your project progress.\n\n*Travel back in time: a version control system makes it easy to compare different time points of your project smoothly. If you want to compare the stage of your project a year ago from now, it only takes one command-line of code\n\n*Experiment with changes: if you want to make changes in a script you can first make a “snapshot” of the project status before experimenting with changes.\n\n*Backup your work: by being able to link your local repository (folder) to a distant online host (GitHub), a version control system backs up your precious work instantly\n\n*Collaborate easily on projects: having a web-hosted synchronised version of your project will encourage collaboration with other researchers. Think about a colleague of yours being able to add a script to make a figure for your publication for instance. The repository will track their contribution and evidence their participation in the project\n \nDONE:\n\n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n*Semantic versioning quiz\nType +1 after the correct answer:\n\n*Which of the library version is the latest?\n*a) 0.12.4\n*b) 1.1.0\n*c) 1.12.3-alpha\n*d) 1.12.2\n*You use library fair.2.3.1 to automatically upload your data after analysis. You found out that there is available new version of the library fair.4.3.1. Which situation is the most probable?\n*a) fair.4.3.1 uploads data twice as fast as fair.2.3.1\n*b) you need to reserve time to test the new version and adapt your analysis pipeline to work with it\n*c) both versions offer the same features and bug fixes as they have the same minor/path version 3.1\n*You developed code that helps to plot detrended and normalized data, the last release has version 1.2.1.

Ballou et al. 2020\nhttps://github.com/ewallace/pseudonuclease_evolution_2020/commits/master\n·       data from I. Boehm et al. 2020\nhttps://github.com/BioRDM/nmj-pig/commits/main\nGive examples of:\n·       what makes them a good changelog\n·       what could be improved\nThink which are the most difficult features to replicate with manual version control?\n \n \n-------------------------------------------------\nFive reasons to use a version control system in research, give +1 to the two most important for you\n  \n*Tell the story: The history of your commit messages will describe your project progress.\n \n*Travel back in time: a version control system makes it easy to compare different time points of your project smoothly. If you want to compare the stage of your project a year ago from now, it only takes one command-line of code.\n \n*Experiment with changes: if you want to make changes in a script you can first make a “snapshot” of the project status before experimenting with changes.\n \n*Backup your work: by being able to link your local repository (folder) to a distant online host (GitHub), a version control system backs up your precious work instantly\n \n*Collaborate easily on projects: having a web-hosted synchronised version of your project will encourage collaboration with other researchers. Think about a colleague of yours being able to add a script to make a figure for your publication for instance. The repository will track their contribution and evidence their participation in the project\n \nDONE\n \nSemantic versioning quiz\n*Which of the library version is the latest?\n*a) 0.12.4\n*b) 1.1.0\n*c) 1.12.3-alpha\n*d) 1.12.2\n*You use library fair.2.3.1 to automatically upload your data after analysis. You found out that there is available new version of the library fair.4.3.1. Which situation is the most probable?\n*a) fair.4.3.1 uploads data twice as fast as fair.2.3.1\n*b) you need to reserve time to test the new version and adapt your analysis pipeline to work with it\n*c) both versions offer the same features and bug fixes as they have the same minor/path version 3.1\n*You developed code that helps to plot detrended and normalized data, the last release has version 1.2.1. You added Z-score to the available normalization methods and fixed the spelling errors in the user messages.

Public general record\nHave a look at the following record for data set in Zenodo repository:\nhttps://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5045374\n \n1.       What elements make it FAIR?  \n \nFINDABLE (persistent identifiers, easy to find data and metadata):\n- Has a DOI (a unique identifier)\n- Has a rich set of keywords so if I searched for \"neuromuscular junction\" I should find it, etc.\nACCESSIBLE (The (meta)data retrievable by their identifier using a standard web protocols):\n- \n- I don't know what \"Pig 1.zip\", \"Pig 2.zip\" etc mean, immediately? Even reading through the readme it's not completely clear. +1 \nINTEROPERABLE (The format of the data should be open and interpretable for various tools):\n- Method files are txt not proprietary file formats (like .docx)\n-Despite using .nd2 files they do explain how to open them in the README .nd2 files can be opened with Fiji (https://imagej.net/software/fiji/).\nREUSABLE (data should be well-described so that they can be replicated and/or combined in different settings, reuse states with a clear licence):\n-Has a license file and README\n- clear 'code-book' information in README file describing key file types, abbreviations/data headings and brief methodology, makes it easier to replicate/understand at a glance\n\n2.       Skim through the data set description (HINT there is also a README), try to judge using marks from 0 to 5 (5 best) if\n-          It is clear what the content of the data set is:\n·     - 5 \n·     - 4\n·     - 5\n·     - 5 55\n-          It is clear why (what for) the data could be used:\n·     - 55 555 44\n-          It is well described 5 5 44555\n-          How confident will you be to work with this data set: 3343 333\n-          How easy it is to access the data set content:555 5555\n \n3.       Give +1 to the statement that the best describes your latest public dataset or a current project folder:\n-          It does not have readme like description:\n-          It description has only one/two paragraph(s), I have not thought of adding so many details: +1 +1+1\n-          My data set description is similar in details: +1\n-          My data /project description is much richer or formalised:\n \nAside from Edward: It is interesting that they have mac filesystem debris, .DS_store\n It is easy to accidentally add that to a git repository or a zip file.\n \nE2. Dataset discovery \n \nTry to find either:\n-  similar data sets in Zenodo\n- data sets interesting for you  \n \nJudge using marks from 0 to 5 (5 best)\n- how easy is to find similar or interesting dataset: 4 323321\n- It is clear what the content of the data set is: 22 222\n- It is clear why (what for) the data could be used: 32222\n- They are well described :22322\n \n \nE3. Domain specific repositories.  \n  \nSelect one of the following repositories based on your expertise/interests:  \n  \nHave a look at mRNAseq accession 'E-MTAB-7933' in [ArrayExpress] ++ +(https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-7933/)  \n-          What makes it better than Zenodo: Last update date, ENA link, structured description+\n-          What domain specific features can you see: can pull out sample-specific fastq files easily without downloading whole set+; protocol info is clearly available; time/strain information clear for samples+\n-          Searching: not totally certain whether this is used in a publication - no obvious link? There is citation info (but I wasn't sure if it's for the dataset or a publication elsewhere?) It would help if the citation had a DOI to link to it.\nNot easy to find other A. thaliana datasets from this dataset. \n \n> - Have a look at microscopy 'project-1101' in [IDR](https://idr.openmicroscopy.org/webclient/?show=project-1101)  \n-          What makes it better than Zenodo:\n-          What domain specific features can you see:\n-          Searching:\n \n \n> - Have a look at the synthethic part record 'SubtilinReceiver_spaRK_separated' within the 'bsu' collection in [SynBioHub](https://synbiohub.org/public/bsu/SubtilinReceiver_spaRK_separated/1)  \n-          What makes it better than Zenodo: Visual pictures of the genetic parts. Icons to indicate differnt kinds of parts.\n-          What domain specific features can you see: SBOL language\n-          Searching:\n-          Worse than Zenodo: no text descriptions that we could find. If we don't know what the abbreviation means, we are lost.\n \n \n> - Have a look at the proteomics record 'PXD013039' in [PRIDE](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD013039)  \n-          What makes it better than Zenodo:\n-          What domain specific features can you see:\n-          Searching:\n \n \n> - Have a look at the metabolomics record 'MTBLS2289' in [Metabolights](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS2289/descriptors)  +1\n-          What makes it better than Zenodo: Search tools and data exploration visualisation are based on common metabolomic questions and data structures.\nI REALLY LIKE IT!!!\n-          What domain specific features can you see: Specific tab for seeing which metabolites were present in the study\n-          Searching: A little annoying that the searchable tags and descriptor key words are not the same (why can't I search by clicking on a descriptor key word)\nReally like the Taxonomy Browser so you can easily see similar studies in related organisms\nSeparate seach tool for honing in on compounds based on different charactoristics\n \n \nE4. Finding repository\n \nFirstly, check the publisher's / funder' recommended list of repositories, some of which can be found below:\n- [BioMed Central / Springer Nature](https://www.springernature.com/gp/authors/research-data-policy/recommended-repositories)\n- [eLife](https://submit.elifesciences.org/html/elife_author_instructions.html#policies)\n- [Elsevier](https://www.elsevier.com/about/policies/research-data)\n- [EMBO Press](https://www.embopress.org/page/journal/14602075/authorguide#datadeposition)\n- [F1000 Research](https://f1000research.com/for-authors/data-guidelines)\n- [GIGAscience - OUP](https://academic.oup.com/gigascience/pages/instructions_to_authors)\n- [PLoS](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/s/recommended-repositories)\n- [Scientific Data - Nature](https://www.nature.com/sdata/policies/repositories)\n- [Taylor and Francis](https://authorservices.taylorandfrancis.com/data-sharing-policies/repositories/)\n- [BBSRC](https://bbsrc.ukri.org/research/resources/)\n- [NERC](https://nerc.ukri.org/research/sites/environmental-data-service-eds/policy/)\n- [Royal Society](https://royalsociety.org/journals/ethics-policies/data-sharing-mining/)\n- [Wellcome Open Research](https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/for-authors/data-guidelines)  \n   \nSecondly, check [Fairsharing recommendations](https://fairsharing.org/recommendations/?q=)\n    - alternatively, check the [Registry of research data repositories - re3data](https://www.re3data.org/)\n     \na)       Find and type a repo for genomics data: \n \nGenbank \nFungiDB :)\n·    EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database (ENA)\n*·    REvGenUK\n·    Gene Expression Omnibus for RNA-seq and microarray data (functional genomics)\n \nc)       Your favourite/chosen data type and recommended repo:\n \n-\n-\n-\n \n \nd)      List repositories you have used (either to download or to share your data):\n- \n- zenodo, figshare, \n-figshare","meta":{"author":"a.AEJpCALtUn8ZVvDR","timestamp":1634551123355}},"pad:2021-10-21_ed-dash_fair-bio-practice:revs:60":{"changeset":"Z:cyn>3g1|n=ta|a-a5-1*0*a+r*0|5+41*0+y*0*a+14*0|1+p*0+k*0*a+9*0|i+n7*0*a+t*0|h+149*0*a+p*0|d+fe*0*a+w*0|7+b6*0*a+a*0|b+41*0*a+1*0|1+1*0*a+y*0|d+qc*0+1u$Basics of Jupyter Notebooks\nOpen this Jupyter Notebook: http://mango.bio.ed.ac.uk:8888/tree  \n \nWe will first show you how to duplicate a notebook, save it and run code.\n \n1.     Select the notebook titled 'student_notebook_light_conditions.ipynb' and click 'Duplicate'.\n2.     Confirm with Duplicate when asked if you are certain that you want to duplicate the notebook.\n3.     A copy of the notebook has appeared with the suffix '-Copy' and a number. Explore the anatomy of the notebook (https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/fair-bio-practice/blob/gh-pages/fig/10-02-jupyter_anatomy.png)\n4.     Change the title of the notebook from -copy number to your initials e.g. “student_notebook_light_conditions_IB”\n5.     Save the notebook: Click on the disk symbol in the toolbar\n6.     Run the notebook: Select the top cell of the notebook with the title (this is likely pre-selected already and will show with a light-blue bar to its left), and click “Run” in the tool bar.\n7.     Click two times. What can you see?\n-\n-\n-\n-\n8.     We want to run ALL the code: In the top tool bar click Cell > Run All. What can you see?\n-\n-\n-\n-\n \n \n \nHow to add and remove content\n \nYou have duplicated a notebook and saved it under your own name. Now we will add text, remove cells and change code.\n \n \n1.     Change the author name of the document to your name: Double click on the cell containing the author name and change the name.\n2.     Press Run again.\n3.     Add a new cell: Let us add details about the “light_results.txt” file that is loaded. The “+” in the tool bar creates new cells below the currently selected cell. Thus select the cell above the code and click “+” in the toolbar.\n4.     Ensure the type of the cell is Markdown and enter a description of subsequent analysis e.g.: “Loading of results following short- and long-day light exposure on arabidopsis, followed by visualisation of differences in chlorophyll/biomas etc... content between genotypes on short-days and long-days.”\n5.     Press Run again.\n6.     To remove a cell, select the cell you have just created and click on the scissors icon in the toolbar. (This can be undone under Edit > Undo Delete Cells)\n7.     Change colours of your graph: Where the code of the graph reads the comment “# change colour of groups” you can replace the HEX codes, # followed by 6-symbol code, with names of colours (e.g. blue, green…) or other HEX codes if you are familiar with them.\n8.     Save graph under new name: Add your initials to the file name under which the image is saved. Press Run. Your image should be visible in overall file hierarchy.\n \n \n \n \nAdd another analysis step\n \nWe have shown you how to manipulate text and code in Jupyter notebooks. You should be able to add data visualisation (a graph) and stats for long-day light condition including annotations yourself.\n \n1.     Add additional cells including\na.     Titles\nb.     Edited code to depict graph from long-days (saved under different name)\nc.     Figure legend\nd.     Statistical testing of difference between genotypes on long-days (remember to assign a different variable throughout e.g. LD.aov)\ne.     Interpretation of results of statistical testing\n \n \n \nSharing of your Jupyter Notebook\n \nYou have now generated your own analysis and interpretation on top of your collaborators results and want to share this with your colleagues.\n \n1.     Download your Notebook (ensure all code has been run) as .html and .pdf\n2.     View the documents and think about why it is important to run all code before download (try Cell > All Output > Clear and download your Notebook, compare the outputs)\n \nQuestions:\nWhat is the difference between running all code and clearing all run code?\n-\n-\n-\n \nWhy is it important to run all code before download?\n-\n-\n-\n \n \nAccessibility of Jupyter Notebooks\nOn a scale from -2 to 2, how do you feel about the following statements (R is interchangeable with Python), where -2 (strongly disagree), 0 no\nopinion to +2 strongly agree:\n \nType a number between -2 to 2 behind the statement:\n·      making graphs for a subset of data is easier in R than in Excel:\n·      it is easier to filter for data in R than in Excel:\n·      it is easier to apply formulas or calculations in R than in Excel:\n·      it is easier to generate a series of plots with similar layout in R than Excel:\n·      it is easier to do large scale data processing in R than in Excel:\n·      using

Select the notebook titled 'student_notebook_light_conditions.ipynb' and click 'Duplicate'.\n2.     Confirm with Duplicate when asked if you are certain that you want to duplicate the notebook.\n3.     A copy of the notebook has appeared with the suffix '-Copy' and a number. Explore the anatomy of the notebook (https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/fair-bio-practice/blob/gh-pages/fig/10-02-jupyter_anatomy.png)\n4.     Change the title of the notebook from -copy number to your initials e.g. “student_notebook_light_conditions_IB”\n5.     Save the notebook: Click on the disk symbol in the toolbar\n6.     Run the notebook: Select the top cell of the notebook with the title (this is likely pre-selected already and will show with a light-blue bar to its left), and click “Run” in the tool bar.\n7.     Click two times. What can you see?\n-\n-\n-\n-\n8.     We want to run ALL the code: In the top tool bar click Cell > Run All. What can you see?\n-\n-\n-\n-\n \n \n \nHow to add and remove content\n \nYou have duplicated a notebook and saved it under your own name. Now we will add text, remove cells and change code.\n \n \n1.     Change the author name of the document to your name: Double click on the cell containing the author name and change the name.\n2.     Press Run again.\n3.     Add a new cell: Let us add details about the “light_results.txt” file that is loaded. The “+” in the tool bar creates new cells below the currently selected cell. Thus select the cell above the code and click “+” in the toolbar.\n4.     Ensure the type of the cell is Markdown and enter a description of subsequent analysis e.g.: “Loading of results following short- and long-day light exposure on arabidopsis, followed by visualisation of differences in chlorophyll/biomas etc... content between genotypes on short-days and long-days.”\n5.     Press Run again.\n6.     To remove a cell, select the cell you have just created and click on the scissors icon in the toolbar. (This can be undone under Edit > Undo Delete Cells)\n7.     Change colours of your graph: Where the code of the graph reads the comment “# change colour of groups” you can replace the HEX codes, # followed by 6-symbol code, with names of colours (e.g. blue, green…) or other HEX codes if you are familiar with them.\n8.     Save graph under new name: Add your initials to the file name under which the image is saved. Press Run. Your image should be visible in overall file hierarchy.\n \n \n \n \nAdd another analysis step\n \nWe have shown you how to manipulate text and code in Jupyter notebooks. You should be able to add data visualisation (a graph) and stats for long-day light condition including annotations yourself.\n \n1.     Add additional cells including\na.     Titles\nb.     Edited code to depict graph from long-days (saved under different name)\nc.     Figure legend\nd.     Statistical testing of difference between genotypes on long-days (remember to assign a different variable throughout e.g. LD.aov)\ne.     Interpretation of results of statistical testing\n \n \n \nSharing of your Jupyter Notebook\n \nYou have now generated your own analysis and interpretation on top of your collaborators results and want to share this with your colleagues.\n \n1.     Download your Notebook (ensure all code has been run) as .html and .pdf\n2.     View the documents and think about why it is important to run all code before download (try Cell > All Output > Clear and download your Notebook, compare the outputs)\n \nQuestions:\nWhat is the difference between running all code and clearing all run code?\n-\n-\n-\n \nWhy is it important to run all code before download?\n-\n-\n-\n \n \nAccessibility of Jupyter Notebooks\nOn a scale from -2 to 2, how do you feel about the following statements (R is interchangeable with Python), where -2 (strongly disagree), 0 no\nopinion to +2 strongly agree:\n \nType a number between -2 to 2 behind the statement:\n·      making graphs for a subset of data is easier in R than in Excel:\n·      it is easier to filter for data in R than in Excel:\n·      it is easier to apply formulas or calculations in R than in Excel:\n·      it is easier to generate a series of plots with similar layout in R than Excel:\n·      it is easier to do large scale data processing in R than in Excel:\n·      using notebooks does not require any programming knowledge:\n·      notebooks give you a better overview of your data processing than Excel:\n·      Jupyter is free, whilst a Microsoft Office (+Excel) suite costs $149.99, this alone is an incentive to use Jupyter notebooks as not all individuals have Microsoft Office supported by their employers:\n·      you need to learn R to do any data processing in notebooks:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n*Lesson 11: Version Control\nProblems with a change\n \nWhich of these issues can you relate to?

Ballou et al. 2020\nhttps://github.com/ewallace/pseudonuclease_evolution_2020/commits/master\n·       data from I. Boehm et al. 2020\nhttps://github.com/BioRDM/nmj-pig/commits/main\nGive examples of:\n·       what makes them a good changelog\n·       what could be improved\nThink which are the most difficult features to replicate with manual version control?\n \n \n-------------------------------------------------\nFive reasons to use a version control system in research, give +1 to the two most important for you\n  \n*Tell the story: The history of your commit messages will describe your project progress.\n \n*Travel back in time: a version control system makes it easy to compare different time points of your project smoothly. If you want to compare the stage of your project a year ago from now, it only takes one command-line of code.\n \n*Experiment with changes: if you want to make changes in a script you can first make a “snapshot” of the project status before experimenting with changes.\n \n*Backup your work: by being able to link your local repository (folder) to a distant online host (GitHub), a version control system backs up your precious work instantly\n \n*Collaborate easily on projects: having a web-hosted synchronised version of your project will encourage collaboration with other researchers. Think about a colleague of yours being able to add a script to make a figure for your publication for instance. The repository will track their contribution and evidence their participation in the project\n \nDONE\n \nSemantic versioning quiz\n*Which of the library version is the latest?\n*a) 0.12.4\n*b) 1.1.0\n*c) 1.12.3-alpha\n*d) 1.12.2\n*You use library fair.2.3.1 to automatically upload your data after analysis. You found out that there is available new version of the library fair.4.3.1. Which situation is the most probable?\n*a) fair.4.3.1 uploads data twice as fast as fair.2.3.1\n*b) you need to reserve time to test the new version and adapt your analysis pipeline to work with it\n*c) both versions offer the same features and bug fixes as they have the same minor/path version 3.1\n*You developed code that helps to plot detrended and normalized data, the last release has version 1.2.1. You added Z-score to the available normalization methods and fixed the spelling errors in the user messages. Which version number should you give to the new release:\n*a) 2.0.0\n*b) 1.3.0\n*c) 1.3.2\n*d) 1.2.2\n*e) 2.2.1\n*Your group releases data about studied cancer patients following semantic versioning. The last data sets are released as 1.11, you added data from a new patient,\n*what version should you use:\n*a) 1.12\n*b) 2.11\n*c) 2.0\n*You were asked to better anonymize the above cancer data (v1.11) in future releases. Instead of data and time of patient visit you release only the year, the hospital names have been encoded and patient age has been obscured by random noise.\n*What version should you use:\n*a) 1.12\n*b) 2.11\n*c) 2.0\n \nDONE:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n*Lesson 12: Public repositories\nE1. Public general record\nHave a look at the following record for data set in Zenodo repository:\nhttps://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5045374\n \n1.       What elements make it FAIR?  \n \nFINDABLE (persistent identifiers, easy to find data and metadata):\n- Has a DOI (a unique identifier)\n- Has a rich set of keywords so if I searched for \"neuromuscular junction\" I should find it, etc.\nACCESSIBLE (The (meta)data retrievable by their identifier using a standard web protocols):\n- \n- I don't know what \"Pig 1.zip\", \"Pig 2.zip\" etc mean, immediately? Even reading through the readme it's not completely clear. +1 \nINTEROPERABLE (The format of the data should be open and interpretable for various tools):\n- Method files are txt not proprietary file formats (like .docx)\n-Despite using .nd2 files they do explain how to open them in the README .nd2 files can be opened with Fiji (https://imagej.net/software/fiji/).\nREUSABLE (data should be well-described so that they can be replicated and/or combined in different settings, reuse states with a clear licence):\n-Has a license file and README\n- clear 'code-book' information in README file describing key file types, abbreviations/data headings and brief methodology, makes it easier to replicate/understand at a glance\n\n2.       Skim through the data set description (HINT there is also a README), try to judge using marks from 0 to 5 (5 best) if\n-          It is clear what the content of the data set is:\n·     - 5 \n·     - 4\n·     - 5\n·     - 5 55\n-          It is clear why (what for) the data could be used:\n·     - 55 555 44\n-          It is well described 5 5 44555\n-          How confident will you be to work with this data set: 3343 333\n-          How easy it is to access the data set content:555 5555\n \n3.       Give +1 to the statement that the best describes your latest public dataset or a current project folder:\n-          It does not have readme like description:\n-          It description has only one/two paragraph(s), I have not thought of adding so many details: +1 +1+1\n-          My data set description is similar in details: +1\n-          My data /project description is much richer or formalised:\n \nAside from Edward: It is interesting that they have mac filesystem debris, .DS_store\n It is easy to accidentally add that to a git repository or a zip file.\n \nE2. Dataset discovery \n \nTry to find either:\n-  similar data sets in Zenodo\n- data sets interesting for you  \n \nJudge using marks from 0 to 5 (5 best)\n- how easy is to find similar or interesting dataset: 4 323321\n- It is clear what the content of the data set is: 22 222\n- It is clear why (what for) the data could be used: 32222\n- They are well described :22322\n \n \nE3. Domain specific repositories.  \n  \nSelect one of the following repositories based on your expertise/interests:  \n  \nHave a look at mRNAseq accession 'E-MTAB-7933' in [ArrayExpress] ++ +(https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-7933/)  \n-          What makes it better than Zenodo: Last update date, ENA link, structured description+\n-          What domain specific features can you see: can pull out sample-specific fastq files easily without downloading whole set+; protocol info is clearly available; time/strain information clear for samples+\n-          Searching: not totally certain whether this is used in a publication - no obvious link? There is citation info (but I wasn't sure if it's for the dataset or a publication elsewhere?) It would help if the citation had a DOI to link to it.\nNot easy to find other A. thaliana datasets from this dataset. \n \n> - Have a look at microscopy 'project-1101' in [IDR](https://idr.openmicroscopy.org/webclient/?show=project-1101)  \n-          What makes it better than Zenodo:\n-          What domain specific features can you see:\n-          Searching:\n \n \n> - Have a look at the synthethic part record 'SubtilinReceiver_spaRK_separated' within the 'bsu' collection in [SynBioHub](https://synbiohub.org/public/bsu/SubtilinReceiver_spaRK_separated/1)  \n-          What makes it better than Zenodo: Visual pictures of the genetic parts. Icons to indicate differnt kinds of parts.\n-          What domain specific features can you see: SBOL language\n-          Searching:\n-          Worse than Zenodo: no text descriptions that we could find. If we don't know what the abbreviation means, we are lost.\n \n \n> - Have a look at the proteomics record 'PXD013039' in [PRIDE](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD013039)  \n-          What makes it better than Zenodo:\n-          What domain specific features can you see:\n-          Searching:\n \n \n> - Have a look at the metabolomics record 'MTBLS2289' in [Metabolights](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS2289/descriptors)  +1\n-          What makes it better than Zenodo: Search tools and data exploration visualisation are based on common metabolomic questions and data structures.\nI REALLY LIKE IT!!!\n-          What domain specific features can you see: Specific tab for seeing which metabolites were present in the study\n-          Searching: A little annoying that the searchable tags and descriptor key words are not the same (why can't I search by clicking on a descriptor key word)\nReally like the Taxonomy Browser so you can easily see similar studies in related organisms\nSeparate seach tool for honing in on compounds based on different charactoristics\n \n \nE4. Finding repository\n \nFirstly, check the publisher's / funder' recommended list of repositories, some of which can be found below:\n- [BioMed Central / Springer Nature](https://www.springernature.com/gp/authors/research-data-policy/recommended-repositories)\n- [eLife](https://submit.elifesciences.org/html/elife_author_instructions.html#policies)\n- [Elsevier](https://www.elsevier.com/about/policies/research-data)\n- [EMBO Press](https://www.embopress.org/page/journal/14602075/authorguide#datadeposition)\n- [F1000 Research](https://f1000research.com/for-authors/data-guidelines)\n- [GIGAscience - OUP](https://academic.oup.com/gigascience/pages/instructions_to_authors)\n- [PLoS](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/s/recommended-repositories)\n- [Scientific Data - Nature](https://www.nature.com/sdata/policies/repositories)\n- [Taylor and Francis](https://authorservices.taylorandfrancis.com/data-sharing-policies/repositories/)\n- [BBSRC](https://bbsrc.ukri.org/research/resources/)\n- [NERC](https://nerc.ukri.org/research/sites/environmental-data-service-eds/policy/)\n- [Royal Society](https://royalsociety.org/journals/ethics-policies/data-sharing-mining/)\n- [Wellcome Open Research](https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/for-authors/data-guidelines)  \n   \nSecondly, check [Fairsharing recommendations](https://fairsharing.org/recommendations/?q=)\n    - alternatively, check the [Registry of research data repositories - re3data](https://www.re3data.org/)\n     \na)       Find and type a repo for genomics data: \n \nGenbank \nFungiDB :)\n·    EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database (ENA)\n*·    REvGenUK\n·    Gene Expression Omnibus for RNA-seq and microarray data (functional genomics)\n \nc)       Your favourite/chosen data type and recommended repo:\n \n-\n-\n-\n \n \nd)      List repositories you have used (either to download or to share your data):\n- \n- zenodo, figshare, \n-figshare\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n*Lesson 13: It's all about planning\nExercise 1.

Select the notebook titled 'student_notebook_light_conditions.ipynb' and click 'Duplicate'.\n2.    Confirm with Duplicate when asked if you are certain that you want to duplicate the notebook.\n3.    A copy of the notebook has appeared with the suffix '-Copy' and a number. Explore the anatomy of the notebook (https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/fair-bio-practice/blob/gh-pages/fig/10-02-jupyter_anatomy.png)\n4.    Change the title of the notebook from -copy number to your initials e.g. “student_notebook_light_conditions_IB”\n5.    Save the notebook: Click on the disk symbol in the toolbar\n6.    Run the notebook: Select the top cell of the notebook with the title (this is likely pre-selected already and will show with a light-blue bar to its left), and click “Run” in the tool bar.\n7.    Click two times. What can you see?\n-\n-\n-\n-\n8.    We want to run ALL the code: In the top tool bar click Cell > Run All. What can you see?\n-\n-\n-\n-\n \n DONE: \n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n* Exercise 2: How to add and remove content\nYou have duplicated a notebook and saved it under your own name. Now we will add text, remove cells and change code.\n \n1.     Change the author name of the document to your name: Double click on the cell containing the author name and change the name.\n2.     Press Run again.\n3.     Add a new cell: Let us add details about the “light_results.txt” file that is loaded. The “+” in the tool bar creates new cells below the currently selected cell. Thus select the cell above the code and click “+” in the toolbar.\n4.     Ensure the type of the cell is Markdown and enter a description of subsequent analysis e.g.: “Loading of results following short- and long-day light exposure on arabidopsis, followed by visualisation of differences in chlorophyll/biomas etc... content between genotypes on short-days and long-days.”\n5.     Press Run again.\n6.     To remove a cell, select the cell you have just created and click on the scissors icon in the toolbar. (This can be undone under Edit > Undo Delete Cells)\n7.     Change colours of your graph: Where the code of the graph reads the comment “# change colour of groups” you can replace the HEX codes, # followed by 6-symbol code, with names of colours (e.g. blue, green…) or other HEX codes if you are familiar with them.\n8.     Save graph under new name: Add your initials to the file name under which the image is saved. Press Run. Your image should be visible in overall file hierarchy.\n \nDONE:\n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n*Exercise 3: Add another analysis step\nWe have shown you how to manipulate text and code in Jupyter notebooks. You should be able to add data visualisation (a graph) and stats for long-day light condition including annotations yourself.\n \n1.     Add additional cells including\na.     Titles\nb.     Edited code to depict graph from long-days (saved under different name)\nc.     Figure legend\nd.     Statistical testing of difference between genotypes on long-days (remember to assign a different variable throughout e.g. LD.aov)\ne.     Interpretation of results of statistical testing\n\nDONE:\n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n*Exercise 4: Sharing of your Jupyter Notebook\nYou have now generated your own analysis and interpretation on top of your collaborators results and want to share this with your colleagues.\n \n1.     Download your Notebook (ensure all code has been run) as .html and .pdf\n2.    View the documents and think about why it is important to run all code before download (try Cell > All Output > Clear and download your Notebook, compare the outputs)\n \nQuestions:\nWhat is the difference between running all code and clearing all run code?\n-\n-\n-\n \nWhy is it important to run all code before download?\n-\n-\n-\n \nDONE:\n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n*Exercise 5: Accessibility of Jupyter Notebooks\nOn a scale from -2 to 2, how do you feel about the following statements (R is interchangeable with Python), \nwhere -2 (strongly disagree), 0 no opinion to +2 strongly agree:\n \nType a number between -2 to 2 behind the statement:\n·      making graphs for a subset of data is easier in R than in Excel:\n·      it is easier to filter for data in R than in Excel:\n·      it is easier to apply formulas or calculations in R than in Excel:\n·      it is easier to generate a series of plots with similar layout in R than Excel:\n·      it is easier to do large scale data processing in R than in Excel:\n·      using notebooks does not require any programming knowledge:\n·      notebooks give you a better overview of your data processing than Excel:\n·      Jupyter is free, whilst a Microsoft Office (+Excel) suite costs $149.99, this alone is an incentive to use Jupyter notebooks as not all individuals have Microsoft Office supported by their employers:\n·      you need to learn R to do any data processing in notebooks:\n\nDONE:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n*Lesson 11: Version Control\n\n*Exercise 1: Problems with a change\nWhich of these issues can you relate to? (Type +1 next to each statement if you relate to it)\n*I have fifteen versions of this file - which one do I use?\n*I can’t remake this figure from last year\n*I slightly modified my code in one place, everything stopped working\n*I have several copies of the same directory because I'm worried about breaking something\n*Somebody added erroneous records in a shared file with samples, cannot find who and why\n*You remember seeing a data file but cannot find it anymore: is it deleted? Moved away?\n*I tried multiple analysis and I don't remember which one I chose to generate my output data\n*I have to merge changes to our manuscript from 10 different emails with collaborators\n*I accidentally deleted a part of my work\n*I came to an old project and forgot where I left/saved it\n*I reorganized my data files, but broke the analysis pipeline and don't know how to fix it\n*I have trouble to find the source of a mistake in an experiment\n*My directory is polluted with a lot of unused/temporary/old folders because I'm afraid of losing something important\n*I made a lot of changes to my paper but want to bring back one paragraph\n \nDONE:\n\n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n*Exercise 2: Manual Versioning\nWhich of these issues does manual versioning help to tackle?\n(Type +1 next to each statement if manual versioning helps to tackle)\n \n·      I have fifteen versions of this file and I don't know which one to use\n·      I can't remake this figure from last year\n·      I slightly modified my code in one place, everything stopped working\n·      I have several copies of the same directory because I'm worried about breaking something\n·      Somebody added erroneous records in a shared file with samples, I cannot find who and why\n·      I tried multiple analysis and I don't remember which one I chose to generate my output data\n·      I have to merge changes to our manuscript from 10 different emails from collaborators\n·      I made a lot of changes to my paper but want to bring back one paragraph\n \nDONE:\n \n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n*Exercise 3: Accessibility of Jupyter Notebooks\nChangelog in action\nHave a look at one of the example Github repositories and how they track changes*:\n·       data from E.R. Ballou et al. 2020\nhttps://github.com/ewallace/pseudonuclease_evolution_2020/commits/master\n·       data from I. Boehm et al. 2020\nhttps://github.com/BioRDM/nmj-pig/commits/main\nGive examples of:\n·       what makes them a good changelog\n·       what could be improved\nThink which are the most difficult features to replicate with manual version control?\n \n \n-------------------------------------------------\nFive reasons to use a version control system in research, give +1 to the two most important for you\n  \n*Tell the story: The history of your commit messages will describe your project progress.\n \n*Travel back in time: a version control system makes it easy to compare different time points of your project smoothly. If you want to compare the stage of your project a year ago from now, it only takes one command-line of code.\n \n*Experiment with changes: if you want to make changes in a script you can first make a “snapshot” of the project status before experimenting with changes.\n \n*Backup your work: by being able to link your local repository (folder) to a distant online host (GitHub), a version control system backs up your precious work instantly\n \n*Collaborate easily on projects: having a web-hosted synchronised version of your project will encourage collaboration with other researchers. Think about a colleague of yours being able to add a script to make a figure for your publication for instance. The repository will track their contribution and evidence their participation in the project\n \nDONE\n \nSemantic versioning quiz\n*Which of the library version is the latest?\n*a) 0.12.4\n*b) 1.1.0\n*c) 1.12.3-alpha\n*d) 1.12.2\n*You use library fair.2.3.1 to automatically upload your data after analysis. You found out that there is available new version of the library fair.4.3.1. Which situation is the most probable?\n*a) fair.4.3.1 uploads data twice as fast as fair.2.3.1\n*b) you need to reserve time to test the new version and adapt your analysis pipeline to work with it\n*c) both versions offer the same features and bug fixes as they have the same minor/path version 3.1\n*You developed code that helps to plot detrended and normalized data, the last release has version 1.2.1. You added Z-score to the available normalization methods and fixed the spelling errors in the user messages. Which version number should you give to the new release:\n*a) 2.0.0\n*b) 1.3.0\n*c) 1.3.2\n*d) 1.2.2\n*e) 2.2.1\n*Your group releases data about studied cancer patients following semantic versioning. The last data sets are released as 1.11, you added data from a new patient,\n*what version should you use:\n*a) 1.12\n*b) 2.11\n*c) 2.0\n*You were asked to better anonymize the above cancer data (v1.11) in future releases. Instead of data and time of patient visit you release only the year, the hospital names have been encoded and patient age has been obscured by random noise.\n*What version should you use:\n*a) 1.12\n*b) 2.11\n*c) 2.0\n \nDONE:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n*Lesson 12: Public repositories\nE1. Public general record\nHave a look at the following record for data set in Zenodo repository:\nhttps://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5045374\n \n1.       What elements make it FAIR?  \n \nFINDABLE (persistent identifiers, easy to find data and metadata):\n- Has a DOI (a unique identifier)\n- Has a rich set of keywords so if I searched for \"neuromuscular junction\" I should find it, etc.\nACCESSIBLE (The (meta)data retrievable by their identifier using a standard web protocols):\n- \n- I don't know what \"Pig 1.zip\", \"Pig 2.zip\" etc mean, immediately? Even reading through the readme it's not completely clear. +1 \nINTEROPERABLE (The format of the data should be open and interpretable for various tools):\n- Method files are txt not proprietary file formats (like .docx)\n-Despite using .nd2 files they do explain how to open them in the README .nd2 files can be opened with Fiji (https://imagej.net/software/fiji/).\nREUSABLE (data should be well-described so that they can be replicated and/or combined in different settings, reuse states with a clear licence):\n-Has a license file and README\n- clear 'code-book' information in README file describing key file types, abbreviations/data headings and brief methodology, makes it easier to replicate/understand at a glance\n\n2.       Skim through the data set description (HINT there is also a README), try to judge using marks from 0 to 5 (5 best) if\n-          It is clear what the content of the data set is:\n·     - 5 \n·     - 4\n·     - 5\n·     - 5 55\n-          It is clear why (what for) the data could be used:\n·     - 55 555 44\n-          It is well described 5 5 44555\n-          How confident will you be to work with this data set: 3343 333\n-          How easy it is to access the data set content:555 5555\n \n3.       Give +1 to the statement that the best describes your latest public dataset or a current project folder:\n-          It does not have readme like description:\n-          It description has only one/two paragraph(s), I have not thought of adding so many details: +1 +1+1\n-          My data set description is similar in details: +1\n-          My data /project description is much richer or formalised:\n \nAside from Edward: It is interesting that they have mac filesystem debris, .DS_store\n It is easy to accidentally add that to a git repository or a zip file.\n \nE2. Dataset discovery \n \nTry to find either:\n-  similar data sets in Zenodo\n- data sets interesting for you  \n \nJudge using marks from 0 to 5 (5 best)\n- how easy is to find similar or interesting dataset: 4 323321\n- It is clear what the content of the data set is: 22 222\n- It is clear why (what for) the data could be used: 32222\n- They are well described :22322\n \n \nE3. Domain specific repositories.  \n  \nSelect one of the following repositories based on your expertise/interests:  \n  \nHave a look at mRNAseq accession 'E-MTAB-7933' in [ArrayExpress] ++ +(https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-7933/)  \n-          What makes it better than Zenodo: Last update date, ENA link, structured description+\n-          What domain specific features can you see: can pull out sample-specific fastq files easily without downloading whole set+; protocol info is clearly available; time/strain information clear for samples+\n-          Searching: not totally certain whether this is used in a publication - no obvious link? There is citation info (but I wasn't sure if it's for the dataset or a publication elsewhere?) It would help if the citation had a DOI to link to it.\nNot easy to find other A. thaliana datasets from this dataset. \n \n> - Have a look at microscopy 'project-1101' in [IDR](https://idr.openmicroscopy.org/webclient/?show=project-1101)  \n-          What makes it better than Zenodo:\n-          What domain specific features can you see:\n-          Searching:\n \n \n> - Have a look at the synthethic part record 'SubtilinReceiver_spaRK_separated' within the 'bsu' collection in [SynBioHub](https://synbiohub.org/public/bsu/SubtilinReceiver_spaRK_separated/1)  \n-          What makes it better than Zenodo: Visual pictures of the genetic parts. Icons to indicate differnt kinds of parts.\n-          What domain specific features can you see: SBOL language\n-          Searching:\n-          Worse than Zenodo: no text descriptions that we could find. If we don't know what the abbreviation means, we are lost.\n \n \n> - Have a look at the proteomics record 'PXD013039' in [PRIDE](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD013039)  \n-          What makes it better than Zenodo:\n-          What domain specific features can you see:\n-          Searching:\n \n \n> - Have a look at the metabolomics record 'MTBLS2289' in [Metabolights](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS2289/descriptors)  +1\n-          What makes it better than Zenodo: Search tools and data exploration visualisation are based on common metabolomic questions and data structures.\nI REALLY LIKE IT!!!\n-          What domain specific features can you see: Specific tab for seeing which metabolites were present in the study\n-          Searching: A little annoying that the searchable tags and descriptor key words are not the same (why can't I search by clicking on a descriptor key word)\nReally like the Taxonomy Browser so you can easily see similar studies in related organisms\nSeparate seach tool for honing in on compounds based on different charactoristics\n \n \nE4.

Select the notebook titled 'student_notebook_light_conditions.ipynb' and click 'Duplicate'.\n2.    Confirm with Duplicate when asked if you are certain that you want to duplicate the notebook.\n3.    A copy of the notebook has appeared with the suffix '-Copy' and a number. Explore the anatomy of the notebook (https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/fair-bio-practice/blob/gh-pages/fig/10-02-jupyter_anatomy.png)\n4.    Change the title of the notebook from -copy number to your initials e.g. “student_notebook_light_conditions_IB”\n5.    Save the notebook: Click on the disk symbol in the toolbar\n6.    Run the notebook: Select the top cell of the notebook with the title (this is likely pre-selected already and will show with a light-blue bar to its left), and click “Run” in the tool bar.\n7.    Click two times. What can you see?\n-\n-\n-\n-\n8.    We want to run ALL the code: In the top tool bar click Cell > Run All. What can you see?\n-\n-\n-\n-\n \n DONE: \n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n* Exercise 2: How to add and remove content\nYou have duplicated a notebook and saved it under your own name. Now we will add text, remove cells and change code.\n \n1.     Change the author name of the document to your name: Double click on the cell containing the author name and change the name.\n2.     Press Run again.\n3.     Add a new cell: Let us add details about the “light_results.txt” file that is loaded. The “+” in the tool bar creates new cells below the currently selected cell. Thus select the cell above the code and click “+” in the toolbar.\n4.     Ensure the type of the cell is Markdown and enter a description of subsequent analysis e.g.: “Loading of results following short- and long-day light exposure on arabidopsis, followed by visualisation of differences in chlorophyll/biomas etc... content between genotypes on short-days and long-days.”\n5.     Press Run again.\n6.     To remove a cell, select the cell you have just created and click on the scissors icon in the toolbar. (This can be undone under Edit > Undo Delete Cells)\n7.     Change colours of your graph: Where the code of the graph reads the comment “# change colour of groups” you can replace the HEX codes, # followed by 6-symbol code, with names of colours (e.g. blue, green…) or other HEX codes if you are familiar with them.\n8.     Save graph under new name: Add your initials to the file name under which the image is saved. Press Run. Your image should be visible in overall file hierarchy.\n \nDONE:\n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n*Exercise 3: Add another analysis step\nWe have shown you how to manipulate text and code in Jupyter notebooks. You should be able to add data visualisation (a graph) and stats for long-day light condition including annotations yourself.\n \n1.     Add additional cells including\na.     Titles\nb.     Edited code to depict graph from long-days (saved under different name)\nc.     Figure legend\nd.     Statistical testing of difference between genotypes on long-days (remember to assign a different variable throughout e.g. LD.aov)\ne.     Interpretation of results of statistical testing\n\nDONE:\n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n*Exercise 4: Sharing of your Jupyter Notebook\nYou have now generated your own analysis and interpretation on top of your collaborators results and want to share this with your colleagues.\n \n1.     Download your Notebook (ensure all code has been run) as .html and .pdf\n2.    View the documents and think about why it is important to run all code before download (try Cell > All Output > Clear and download your Notebook, compare the outputs)\n \nQuestions:\nWhat is the difference between running all code and clearing all run code?\n-\n-\n-\n \nWhy is it important to run all code before download?\n-\n-\n-\n \nDONE:\n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n*Exercise 5: Accessibility of Jupyter Notebooks\nOn a scale from -2 to 2, how do you feel about the following statements (R is interchangeable with Python), \nwhere -2 (strongly disagree), 0 no opinion to +2 strongly agree:\n \nType a number between -2 to 2 behind the statement:\n*making graphs for a subset of data is easier in R than in Excel:\n*it is easier to filter for data in R than in Excel:\n*it is easier to apply formulas or calculations in R than in Excel:\n*it is easier to generate a series of plots with similar layout in R than Excel:\n*it is easier to do large scale data processing in R than in Excel:\n*using notebooks does not require any programming knowledge:\n*notebooks give you a better overview of your data processing than Excel:\n*Jupyter is free, whilst a Microsoft Office (+Excel) suite costs $149.99, this alone is an incentive to use Jupyter notebooks as not all individuals have Microsoft Office supported by their employers:\n*you need to learn R to do any data processing in notebooks:\n\nDONE:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n*Lesson 11: Version Control\n\n*Exercise 1: Problems with a change\nWhich of these issues can you relate to? (Type +1 next to each statement if you relate to it)\n*I have fifteen versions of this file - which one do I use?\n*I can’t remake this figure from last year\n*I slightly modified my code in one place, everything stopped working\n*I have several copies of the same directory because I'm worried about breaking something\n*Somebody added erroneous records in a shared file with samples, cannot find who and why\n*You remember seeing a data file but cannot find it anymore: is it deleted? Moved away?\n*I tried multiple analysis and I don't remember which one I chose to generate my output data\n*I have to merge changes to our manuscript from 10 different emails with collaborators\n*I accidentally deleted a part of my work\n*I came to an old project and forgot where I left/saved it\n*I reorganized my data files, but broke the analysis pipeline and don't know how to fix it\n*I have trouble to find the source of a mistake in an experiment\n*My directory is polluted with a lot of unused/temporary/old folders because I'm afraid of losing something important\n*I made a lot of changes to my paper but want to bring back one paragraph\n \nDONE:\n\n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n*Exercise 2: Manual Versioning\nWhich of these issues does manual versioning help to tackle?\n(Type +1 next to each statement if manual versioning helps to tackle)\n \n*I have fifteen versions of this file and I don't know which one to use\n*I can't remake this figure from last year\n*I slightly modified my code in one place, everything stopped working\n*I have several copies of the same directory because I'm worried about breaking something\n*Somebody added erroneous records in a shared file with samples, I cannot find who and why\n*I tried multiple analysis and I don't remember which one I chose to generate my output data\n*I have to merge changes to our manuscript from 10 different emails from collaborators\n*I made a lot of changes to my paper but want to bring back one paragraph\n \nDONE:\n \n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n*Exercise 3: Changelog in action\nHave a look at one of the example Github repositories and how they track changes*:\n*data from E.R. Ballou et al. 2020\n*https://github.com/ewallace/pseudonuclease_evolution_2020/commits/master\n*data from I. Boehm et al. 2020\n*https://github.com/BioRDM/nmj-pig/commits/main\n\nGive examples of:\n*what makes them a good changelog\n*what could be improved\nThink which are the most difficult features to replicate with manual version control?\n -\n -\n -\n \n DONE:\n \n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n*Exercise 4:\nFive reasons to use a version control system in research, give +1 to the two most important for you\n  \n*Tell the story: The history of your commit messages will describe your project progress.\n*Travel back in time: a version control system makes it easy to compare different time points of your project smoothly. If you want to compare the stage of your project a year ago from now, it only takes one command-line of code.\n*Experiment with changes: if you want to make changes in a script you can first make a “snapshot” of the project status before experimenting with changes.\n*Backup your work: by being able to link your local repository (folder) to a distant online host (GitHub), a version control system backs up your precious work instantly\n*Collaborate easily on projects: having a web-hosted synchronised version of your project will encourage collaboration with other researchers. Think about a colleague of yours being able to add a script to make a figure for your publication for instance. The repository will track their contribution and evidence their participation in the project\n \nDONE:\n\n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n*Semantic versioning quiz\nType +1 after the correct answer:\n\n*Which of the library version is the latest?\n*a) 0.12.4\n*b) 1.1.0\n*c) 1.12.3-alpha\n*d) 1.12.2\n*You use library fair.2.3.1 to automatically upload your data after analysis. You found out that there is available new version of the library fair.4.3.1. Which situation is the most probable?\n*a) fair.4.3.1 uploads data twice as fast as fair.2.3.1\n*b) you need to reserve time to test the new version and adapt your analysis pipeline to work with it\n*c) both versions offer the same features and bug fixes as they have the same minor/path version 3.1\n*You developed code that helps to plot detrended and normalized data, the last release has version 1.2.1. You added Z-score to the available normalization methods and fixed the spelling errors in the user messages. Which version number should you give to the new release:\n*a) 2.0.0\n*b) 1.3.0\n*c) 1.3.2\n*d) 1.2.2\n*e) 2.2.1\n*Your group releases data about studied cancer patients following semantic versioning. The last data sets are released as 1.11, you added data from a new patient,\n*what version should you use:\n*a) 1.12\n*b) 2.11\n*c) 2.0\n*You were asked to better anonymize the above cancer data (v1.11) in future releases. Instead of data and time of patient visit you release only the year, the hospital names have been encoded and patient age has been obscured by random noise.\n*What version should you use:\n*a) 1.12\n*b) 2.11\n*c) 2.0\n \nDONE:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n*Lesson 12: Public repositories\nExercise 1. Public general record\nHave a look at the following record for data set in Zenodo repository:\nhttps://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5045374\n \n1.       What elements make it FAIR?  \n \nFINDABLE (persistent identifiers, easy to find data and metadata):\n- Has a DOI (a unique identifier)\n- Has a rich set of keywords so if I searched for \"neuromuscular junction\" I should find it, etc.\nACCESSIBLE (The (meta)data retrievable by their identifier using a standard web protocols):\n- \n- I don't know what \"Pig 1.zip\", \"Pig 2.zip\" etc mean, immediately? Even reading through the readme it's not completely clear. +1 \nINTEROPERABLE (The format of the data should be open and interpretable for various tools):\n- Method files are txt not proprietary file formats (like .docx)\n-Despite using .nd2 files they do explain how to open them in the README .nd2 files can be opened with Fiji (https://imagej.net/software/fiji/).\nREUSABLE (data should be well-described so that they can be replicated and/or combined in different settings, reuse states with a clear licence):\n-Has a license file and README\n- clear 'code-book' information in README file describing key file types, abbreviations/data headings and brief methodology, makes it easier to replicate/understand at a glance\n\n2.       Skim through the data set description (HINT there is also a README), try to judge using marks from 0 to 5 (5 best) if\n-          It is clear what the content of the data set is:\n·     - 5 \n·     - 4\n·     - 5\n·     - 5 55\n-          It is clear why (what for) the data could be used:\n·     - 55 555 44\n-          It is well described 5 5 44555\n-          How confident will you be to work with this data set: 3343 333\n-          How easy it is to access the data set content:555 5555\n \n3.       Give +1 to the statement that the best describes your latest public dataset or a current project folder:\n-          It does not have readme like description:\n-          It description has only one/two paragraph(s), I have not thought of adding so many details: +1 +1+1\n-          My data set description is similar in details: +1\n-          My data /project description is much richer or formalised:\n \nAside from Edward: It is interesting that they have mac filesystem debris, .DS_store\n It is easy to accidentally add that to a git repository or a zip file.\n \nE2. Dataset discovery \n \nTry to find either:\n-  similar data sets in Zenodo\n- data sets interesting for you  \n \nJudge using marks from 0 to 5 (5 best)\n- how easy is to find similar or interesting dataset: 4 323321\n- It is clear what the content of the data set is: 22 222\n- It is clear why (what for) the data could be used: 32222\n- They are well described :22322\n \n \nE3. Domain specific repositories.  \n  \nSelect one of the following repositories based on your expertise/interests:  \n  \nHave a look at mRNAseq accession 'E-MTAB-7933' in [ArrayExpress] ++ +(https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-7933/)  \n-          What makes it better than Zenodo: Last update date, ENA link, structured description+\n-          What domain specific features can you see: can pull out sample-specific fastq files easily without downloading whole set+; protocol info is clearly available; time/strain information clear for samples+\n-          Searching: not totally certain whether this is used in a publication - no obvious link? There is citation info (but I wasn't sure if it's for the dataset or a publication elsewhere?) It would help if the citation had a DOI to link to it.\nNot easy to find other A. thaliana datasets from this dataset. \n \n> - Have a look at microscopy 'project-1101' in [IDR](https://idr.openmicroscopy.org/webclient/?show=project-1101)  \n-          What makes it better than Zenodo:\n-          What domain specific features can you see:\n-          Searching:\n \n \n> - Have a look at the synthethic part record 'SubtilinReceiver_spaRK_separated' within the 'bsu' collection in [SynBioHub](https://synbiohub.org/public/bsu/SubtilinReceiver_spaRK_separated/1)  \n-          What makes it better than Zenodo: Visual pictures of the genetic parts. Icons to indicate differnt kinds of parts.\n-          What domain specific features can you see: SBOL language\n-          Searching:\n-          Worse than Zenodo: no text descriptions that we could find. If we don't know what the abbreviation means, we are lost.\n \n \n> - Have a look at the proteomics record 'PXD013039' in [PRIDE](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD013039)  \n-          What makes it better than Zenodo:\n-          What domain specific features can you see:\n-          Searching:\n \n \n> - Have a look at the metabolomics record 'MTBLS2289' in [Metabolights](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS2289/descriptors)  +1\n-          What makes it better than Zenodo: Search tools and data exploration visualisation are based on common metabolomic questions and data structures.\nI REALLY LIKE IT!!!\n-          What domain specific features can you see: Specific tab for seeing which metabolites were present in the study\n-          Searching: A little annoying that the searchable tags and descriptor key words are not the same (why can't I search by clicking on a descriptor key word)\nReally like the Taxonomy Browser so you can easily see similar studies in related organisms\nSeparate seach tool for honing in on compounds based on different charactoristics\n \n \nE4. Finding repository\n \nFirstly, check the publisher's / funder' recommended list of repositories, some of which can be found below:\n- [BioMed Central / Springer Nature](https://www.springernature.com/gp/authors/research-data-policy/recommended-repositories)\n- [eLife](https://submit.elifesciences.org/html/elife_author_instructions.html#policies)\n- [Elsevier](https://www.elsevier.com/about/policies/research-data)\n- [EMBO Press](https://www.embopress.org/page/journal/14602075/authorguide#datadeposition)\n- [F1000 Research](https://f1000research.com/for-authors/data-guidelines)\n- [GIGAscience - OUP](https://academic.oup.com/gigascience/pages/instructions_to_authors)\n- [PLoS](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/s/recommended-repositories)\n- [Scientific Data - Nature](https://www.nature.com/sdata/policies/repositories)\n- [Taylor and Francis](https://authorservices.taylorandfrancis.com/data-sharing-policies/repositories/)\n- [BBSRC](https://bbsrc.ukri.org/research/resources/)\n- [NERC](https://nerc.ukri.org/research/sites/environmental-data-service-eds/policy/)\n- [Royal Society](https://royalsociety.org/journals/ethics-policies/data-sharing-mining/)\n- [Wellcome Open Research](https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/for-authors/data-guidelines)  \n   \nSecondly, check [Fairsharing recommendations](https://fairsharing.org/recommendations/?q=)\n    - alternatively, check the [Registry of research data repositories - re3data](https://www.re3data.org/)\n     \na)       Find and type a repo for genomics data: \n \nGenbank \nFungiDB :)\n·    EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database (ENA)\n*·    REvGenUK\n·    Gene Expression Omnibus for RNA-seq and microarray data (functional genomics)\n \nc)       Your favourite/chosen data type and recommended repo:\n \n-\n-\n-\n \n \nd)      List repositories you have used (either to download or to share your data):\n- \n- zenodo, figshare, \n-figshare\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n*Lesson 13: It's all about planning\nExercise 1.

Select the notebook titled 'student_notebook_light_conditions.ipynb' and click 'Duplicate'.\n2.    Confirm with Duplicate when asked if you are certain that you want to duplicate the notebook.\n3.    A copy of the notebook has appeared with the suffix '-Copy' and a number. Explore the anatomy of the notebook (https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/fair-bio-practice/blob/gh-pages/fig/10-02-jupyter_anatomy.png)\n4.    Change the title of the notebook from -copy number to your initials e.g. “student_notebook_light_conditions_IB”\n5.    Save the notebook: Click on the disk symbol in the toolbar\n6.    Run the notebook: Select the top cell of the notebook with the title (this is likely pre-selected already and will show with a light-blue bar to its left), and click “Run” in the tool bar.\n7.    Click two times. What can you see?\n-\n-\n-\n-\n8.    We want to run ALL the code: In the top tool bar click Cell > Run All. What can you see?\n-\n-\n-\n-\n \n DONE: \n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n* Exercise 2: How to add and remove content\nYou have duplicated a notebook and saved it under your own name. Now we will add text, remove cells and change code.\n \n1.     Change the author name of the document to your name: Double click on the cell containing the author name and change the name.\n2.     Press Run again.\n3.     Add a new cell: Let us add details about the “light_results.txt” file that is loaded. The “+” in the tool bar creates new cells below the currently selected cell. Thus select the cell above the code and click “+” in the toolbar.\n4.     Ensure the type of the cell is Markdown and enter a description of subsequent analysis e.g.: “Loading of results following short- and long-day light exposure on arabidopsis, followed by visualisation of differences in chlorophyll/biomas etc... content between genotypes on short-days and long-days.”\n5.     Press Run again.\n6.     To remove a cell, select the cell you have just created and click on the scissors icon in the toolbar. (This can be undone under Edit > Undo Delete Cells)\n7.     Change colours of your graph: Where the code of the graph reads the comment “# change colour of groups” you can replace the HEX codes, # followed by 6-symbol code, with names of colours (e.g. blue, green…) or other HEX codes if you are familiar with them.\n8.     Save graph under new name: Add your initials to the file name under which the image is saved. Press Run. Your image should be visible in overall file hierarchy.\n \nDONE:\n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n*Exercise 3: Add another analysis step\nWe have shown you how to manipulate text and code in Jupyter notebooks. You should be able to add data visualisation (a graph) and stats for long-day light condition including annotations yourself.\n \n1.     Add additional cells including\na.     Titles\nb.     Edited code to depict graph from long-days (saved under different name)\nc.     Figure legend\nd.     Statistical testing of difference between genotypes on long-days (remember to assign a different variable throughout e.g. LD.aov)\ne.     Interpretation of results of statistical testing\n\nDONE:\n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n*Exercise 4: Sharing of your Jupyter Notebook\nYou have now generated your own analysis and interpretation on top of your collaborators results and want to share this with your colleagues.\n \n1.     Download your Notebook (ensure all code has been run) as .html and .pdf\n2.    View the documents and think about why it is important to run all code before download (try Cell > All Output > Clear and download your Notebook, compare the outputs)\n \nQuestions:\nWhat is the difference between running all code and clearing all run code?\n-\n-\n-\n \nWhy is it important to run all code before download?\n-\n-\n-\n \nDONE:\n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n*Exercise 5: Accessibility of Jupyter Notebooks\nOn a scale from -2 to 2, how do you feel about the following statements (R is interchangeable with Python), \nwhere -2 (strongly disagree), 0 no opinion to +2 strongly agree:\n \nType a number between -2 to 2 behind the statement:\n*making graphs for a subset of data is easier in R than in Excel:\n*it is easier to filter for data in R than in Excel:\n*it is easier to apply formulas or calculations in R than in Excel:\n*it is easier to generate a series of plots with similar layout in R than Excel:\n*it is easier to do large scale data processing in R than in Excel:\n*using notebooks does not require any programming knowledge:\n*notebooks give you a better overview of your data processing than Excel:\n*Jupyter is free, whilst a Microsoft Office (+Excel) suite costs $149.99, this alone is an incentive to use Jupyter notebooks as not all individuals have Microsoft Office supported by their employers:\n*you need to learn R to do any data processing in notebooks:\n\nDONE:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n*Lesson 11: Version Control\n\n*Exercise 1: Problems with a change\nWhich of these issues can you relate to? (Type +1 next to each statement if you relate to it)\n*I have fifteen versions of this file - which one do I use?\n*I can’t remake this figure from last year\n*I slightly modified my code in one place, everything stopped working\n*I have several copies of the same directory because I'm worried about breaking something\n*Somebody added erroneous records in a shared file with samples, cannot find who and why\n*You remember seeing a data file but cannot find it anymore: is it deleted? Moved away?\n*I tried multiple analysis and I don't remember which one I chose to generate my output data\n*I have to merge changes to our manuscript from 10 different emails with collaborators\n*I accidentally deleted a part of my work\n*I came to an old project and forgot where I left/saved it\n*I reorganized my data files, but broke the analysis pipeline and don't know how to fix it\n*I have trouble to find the source of a mistake in an experiment\n*My directory is polluted with a lot of unused/temporary/old folders because I'm afraid of losing something important\n*I made a lot of changes to my paper but want to bring back one paragraph\n \nDONE:\n\n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n*Exercise 2: Manual Versioning\nWhich of these issues does manual versioning help to tackle?\n(Type +1 next to each statement if manual versioning helps to tackle)\n \n*I have fifteen versions of this file and I don't know which one to use\n*I can't remake this figure from last year\n*I slightly modified my code in one place, everything stopped working\n*I have several copies of the same directory because I'm worried about breaking something\n*Somebody added erroneous records in a shared file with samples, I cannot find who and why\n*I tried multiple analysis and I don't remember which one I chose to generate my output data\n*I have to merge changes to our manuscript from 10 different emails from collaborators\n*I made a lot of changes to my paper but want to bring back one paragraph\n \nDONE:\n \n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n*Exercise 3: Changelog in action\nHave a look at one of the example Github repositories and how they track changes*:\n*data from E.R. Ballou et al. 2020\n*https://github.com/ewallace/pseudonuclease_evolution_2020/commits/master\n*data from I. Boehm et al. 2020\n*https://github.com/BioRDM/nmj-pig/commits/main\n\nGive examples of:\n*what makes them a good changelog\n*what could be improved\nThink which are the most difficult features to replicate with manual version control?\n -\n -\n -\n \n DONE:\n \n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n*Exercise 4:\nFive reasons to use a version control system in research, give +1 to the two most important for you\n  \n*Tell the story: The history of your commit messages will describe your project progress.\n*Travel back in time: a version control system makes it easy to compare different time points of your project smoothly. If you want to compare the stage of your project a year ago from now, it only takes one command-line of code.\n*Experiment with changes: if you want to make changes in a script you can first make a “snapshot” of the project status before experimenting with changes.\n*Backup your work: by being able to link your local repository (folder) to a distant online host (GitHub), a version control system backs up your precious work instantly\n*Collaborate easily on projects: having a web-hosted synchronised version of your project will encourage collaboration with other researchers. Think about a colleague of yours being able to add a script to make a figure for your publication for instance. The repository will track their contribution and evidence their participation in the project\n \nDONE:\n\n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n*Semantic versioning quiz\nType +1 after the correct answer:\n\n*Which of the library version is the latest?\n*a) 0.12.4\n*b) 1.1.0\n*c) 1.12.3-alpha\n*d) 1.12.2\n*You use library fair.2.3.1 to automatically upload your data after analysis. You found out that there is available new version of the library fair.4.3.1. Which situation is the most probable?\n*a) fair.4.3.1 uploads data twice as fast as fair.2.3.1\n*b) you need to reserve time to test the new version and adapt your analysis pipeline to work with it\n*c) both versions offer the same features and bug fixes as they have the same minor/path version 3.1\n*You developed code that helps to plot detrended and normalized data, the last release has version 1.2.1. You added Z-score to the available normalization methods and fixed the spelling errors in the user messages. Which version number should you give to the new release:\n*a) 2.0.0\n*b) 1.3.0\n*c) 1.3.2\n*d) 1.2.2\n*e) 2.2.1\n*Your group releases data about studied cancer patients following semantic versioning. The last data sets are released as 1.11, you added data from a new patient,\n*what version should you use:\n*a) 1.12\n*b) 2.11\n*c) 2.0\n*You were asked to better anonymize the above cancer data (v1.11) in future releases. Instead of data and time of patient visit you release only the year, the hospital names have been encoded and patient age has been obscured by random noise.\n*What version should you use:\n*a) 1.12\n*b) 2.11\n*c) 2.0\n \nDONE:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n*Lesson 12: Public repositories\n*Exercise 1: Public general record\nHave a look at the following record for data set in Zenodo repository:\nhttps://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5045374\n \n*What elements make it FAIR?  \nFINDABLE (persistent identifiers, easy to find data and metadata):\n-\n-\n\nACCESSIBLE (The (meta)data retrievable by their identifier using a standard web protocols):\n-\n-\n\nINTEROPERABLE (The format of the data should be open and interpretable for various tools):\n-\n-\n\nREUSABLE (data should be well-described so that they can be replicated and/or combined in different settings, reuse states with a clear licence):\n-\n-\n\n2.

Give +1 to the statement that the best describes your latest public dataset or a current project folder:\n*It does not have readme like description:\n*It description has only one/two paragraph(s), I have not thought of adding so many details:\n*My data set description is similar in details:\n*My data /project description is much richer or formalised:\n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n*\nExercise 2: Dataset discovery \n \nTry to find either:\n- similar data sets in Zenodo\n- data sets o interesting for you  \n \nJudge using marks from 0 to 5 (5 best)\n- how easy is to find similar or interesting dataset: 4 323321\n- It is clear what the content of the data set is: 22 222\n- It is clear why (what for) the data could be used: 32222\n- They are well described :22322\n \n \nE3. Domain specific repositories.  \n  \nSelect one of the following repositories based on your expertise/interests:  \n  \nHave a look at mRNAseq accession 'E-MTAB-7933' in [ArrayExpress] ++ +(https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-7933/)  \n-          What makes it better than Zenodo: Last update date, ENA link, structured description+\n-          What domain specific features can you see: can pull out sample-specific fastq files easily without downloading whole set+; protocol info is clearly available; time/strain information clear for samples+\n-          Searching: not totally certain whether this is used in a publication - no obvious link? There is citation info (but I wasn't sure if it's for the dataset or a publication elsewhere?) It would help if the citation had a DOI to link to it.\nNot easy to find other A. thaliana datasets from this dataset. \n \n> - Have a look at microscopy 'project-1101' in [IDR](https://idr.openmicroscopy.org/webclient/?show=project-1101)  \n-          What makes it better than Zenodo:\n-          What domain specific features can you see:\n-          Searching:\n \n \n> - Have a look at the synthethic part record 'SubtilinReceiver_spaRK_separated' within the 'bsu' collection in [SynBioHub](https://synbiohub.org/public/bsu/SubtilinReceiver_spaRK_separated/1)  \n-          What makes it better than Zenodo: Visual pictures of the genetic parts.

Change the title of the notebook from -copy number to your initials e.g. “student_notebook_light_conditions_IB”\n5.    Save the notebook: Click on the disk symbol in the toolbar\n6.    Run the notebook: Select the top cell of the notebook with the title (this is likely pre-selected already and will show with a light-blue bar to its left), and click “Run” in the tool bar.\n7.    Click two times. What can you see?\n-\n-\n-\n-\n8.    We want to run ALL the code: In the top tool bar click Cell > Run All. What can you see?\n-\n-\n-\n-\n \n DONE: \n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n* Exercise 2: How to add and remove content\nYou have duplicated a notebook and saved it under your own name. Now we will add text, remove cells and change code.\n \n1.     Change the author name of the document to your name: Double click on the cell containing the author name and change the name.\n2.     Press Run again.\n3.     Add a new cell: Let us add details about the “light_results.txt” file that is loaded. The “+” in the tool bar creates new cells below the currently selected cell. Thus select the cell above the code and click “+” in the toolbar.\n4.     Ensure the type of the cell is Markdown and enter a description of subsequent analysis e.g.: “Loading of results following short- and long-day light exposure on arabidopsis, followed by visualisation of differences in chlorophyll/biomas etc... content between genotypes on short-days and long-days.”\n5.     Press Run again.\n6.     To remove a cell, select the cell you have just created and click on the scissors icon in the toolbar. (This can be undone under Edit > Undo Delete Cells)\n7.     Change colours of your graph: Where the code of the graph reads the comment “# change colour of groups” you can replace the HEX codes, # followed by 6-symbol code, with names of colours (e.g. blue, green…) or other HEX codes if you are familiar with them.\n8.     Save graph under new name: Add your initials to the file name under which the image is saved. Press Run. Your image should be visible in overall file hierarchy.\n \nDONE:\n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n*Exercise 3: Add another analysis step\nWe have shown you how to manipulate text and code in Jupyter notebooks. You should be able to add data visualisation (a graph) and stats for long-day light condition including annotations yourself.\n \n1.     Add additional cells including\na.     Titles\nb.     Edited code to depict graph from long-days (saved under different name)\nc.     Figure legend\nd.     Statistical testing of difference between genotypes on long-days (remember to assign a different variable throughout e.g. LD.aov)\ne.     Interpretation of results of statistical testing\n\nDONE:\n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n*Exercise 4: Sharing of your Jupyter Notebook\nYou have now generated your own analysis and interpretation on top of your collaborators results and want to share this with your colleagues.\n \n1.     Download your Notebook (ensure all code has been run) as .html and .pdf\n2.    View the documents and think about why it is important to run all code before download (try Cell > All Output > Clear and download your Notebook, compare the outputs)\n \nQuestions:\nWhat is the difference between running all code and clearing all run code?\n-\n-\n-\n \nWhy is it important to run all code before download?\n-\n-\n-\n \nDONE:\n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n*Exercise 5: Accessibility of Jupyter Notebooks\nOn a scale from -2 to 2, how do you feel about the following statements (R is interchangeable with Python), \nwhere -2 (strongly disagree), 0 no opinion to +2 strongly agree:\n \nType a number between -2 to 2 behind the statement:\n*making graphs for a subset of data is easier in R than in Excel:\n*it is easier to filter for data in R than in Excel:\n*it is easier to apply formulas or calculations in R than in Excel:\n*it is easier to generate a series of plots with similar layout in R than Excel:\n*it is easier to do large scale data processing in R than in Excel:\n*using notebooks does not require any programming knowledge:\n*notebooks give you a better overview of your data processing than Excel:\n*Jupyter is free, whilst a Microsoft Office (+Excel) suite costs $149.99, this alone is an incentive to use Jupyter notebooks as not all individuals have Microsoft Office supported by their employers:\n*you need to learn R to do any data processing in notebooks:\n\nDONE:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n*Lesson 11: Version Control\n\n*Exercise 1: Problems with a change\nWhich of these issues can you relate to?

If you want to compare the stage of your project a year ago from now, it only takes one command-line of code.\n*Experiment with changes: if you want to make changes in a script you can first make a “snapshot” of the project status before experimenting with changes.\n*Backup your work: by being able to link your local repository (folder) to a distant online host (GitHub), a version control system backs up your precious work instantly\n*Collaborate easily on projects: having a web-hosted synchronised version of your project will encourage collaboration with other researchers. Think about a colleague of yours being able to add a script to make a figure for your publication for instance. The repository will track their contribution and evidence their participation in the project\n \nDONE:\n\n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n*Semantic versioning quiz\nType +1 after the correct answer:\n\n*Which of the library version is the latest?\n*a) 0.12.4\n*b) 1.1.0\n*c) 1.12.3-alpha\n*d) 1.12.2\n*You use library fair.2.3.1 to automatically upload your data after analysis.

Select the notebook titled 'student_notebook_light_conditions.ipynb' and click 'Duplicate'.\n2.    Confirm with Duplicate when asked if you are certain that you want to duplicate the notebook.\n3.    A copy of the notebook has appeared with the suffix '-Copy' and a number. Explore the anatomy of the notebook (https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/fair-bio-practice/blob/gh-pages/fig/10-02-jupyter_anatomy.png)\n4.    Change the title of the notebook from -copy number to your initials e.g. “student_notebook_light_conditions_IB”\n5.    Save the notebook: Click on the disk symbol in the toolbar\n6.    Run the notebook: Select the top cell of the notebook with the title (this is likely pre-selected already and will show with a light-blue bar to its left), and click “Run” in the tool bar.\n7.    Click two times. What can you see?\n-\n-\n-\n-\n8.    We want to run ALL the code: In the top tool bar click Cell > Run All. What can you see?\n-\n-\n-\n-\n \n DONE: \n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n* Exercise 2: How to add and remove content\nYou have duplicated a notebook and saved it under your own name. Now we will add text, remove cells and change code.\n \n1.     Change the author name of the document to your name: Double click on the cell containing the author name and change the name.\n2.     Press Run again.\n3.     Add a new cell: Let us add details about the “light_results.txt” file that is loaded. The “+” in the tool bar creates new cells below the currently selected cell. Thus select the cell above the code and click “+” in the toolbar.\n4.     Ensure the type of the cell is Markdown and enter a description of subsequent analysis e.g.: “Loading of results following short- and long-day light exposure on arabidopsis, followed by visualisation of differences in chlorophyll/biomas etc... content between genotypes on short-days and long-days.”\n5.     Press Run again.\n6.     To remove a cell, select the cell you have just created and click on the scissors icon in the toolbar. (This can be undone under Edit > Undo Delete Cells)\n7.     Change colours of your graph: Where the code of the graph reads the comment “# change colour of groups” you can replace the HEX codes, # followed by 6-symbol code, with names of colours (e.g. blue, green…) or other HEX codes if you are familiar with them.\n8.     Save graph under new name: Add your initials to the file name under which the image is saved. Press Run.

If you want to compare the stage of your project a year ago from now, it only takes one command-line of code.\n*Experiment with changes: if you want to make changes in a script you can first make a “snapshot” of the project status before experimenting with changes.\n*Backup your work: by being able to link your local repository (folder) to a distant online host (GitHub), a version control system backs up your precious work instantly\n*Collaborate easily on projects: having a web-hosted synchronised version of your project will encourage collaboration with other researchers. Think about a colleague of yours being able to add a script to make a figure for your publication for instance. The repository will track their contribution and evidence their participation in the project\n \nDONE:\n\n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n*Semantic versioning quiz\nType +1 after the correct answer:\n\n*Which of the library version is the latest?\n*a) 0.12.4\n*b) 1.1.0\n*c) 1.12.3-alpha\n*d) 1.12.2\n*You use library fair.2.3.1 to automatically upload your data after analysis.

Select the notebook titled 'student_notebook_light_conditions.ipynb' and click 'Duplicate'.\n2.    Confirm with Duplicate when asked if you are certain that you want to duplicate the notebook.\n3.    A copy of the notebook has appeared with the suffix '-Copy' and a number. Explore the anatomy of the notebook (https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/fair-bio-practice/blob/gh-pages/fig/10-02-jupyter_anatomy.png)\n4.    Change the title of the notebook from -copy number to your initials e.g. “student_notebook_light_conditions_IB”\n5.    Save the notebook: Click on the disk symbol in the toolbar\n6.    Run the notebook: Select the top cell of the notebook with the title (this is likely pre-selected already and will show with a light-blue bar to its left), and click “Run” in the tool bar.\n7.    Click two times. What can you see?\n-\n-\n-\n-\n8.    We want to run ALL the code: In the top tool bar click Cell > Run All. What can you see?\n-\n-\n-\n-\n \n DONE: \n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n* Exercise 2: How to add and remove content\nYou have duplicated a notebook and saved it under your own name. Now we will add text, remove cells and change code.\n \n1.     Change the author name of the document to your name: Double click on the cell containing the author name and change the name.\n2.     Press Run again.\n3.     Add a new cell: Let us add details about the “light_results.txt” file that is loaded. The “+” in the tool bar creates new cells below the currently selected cell. Thus select the cell above the code and click “+” in the toolbar.\n4.     Ensure the type of the cell is Markdown and enter a description of subsequent analysis e.g.: “Loading of results following short- and long-day light exposure on arabidopsis, followed by visualisation of differences in chlorophyll/biomas etc... content between genotypes on short-days and long-days.”\n5.     Press Run again.\n6.     To remove a cell, select the cell you have just created and click on the scissors icon in the toolbar. (This can be undone under Edit > Undo Delete Cells)\n7.     Change colours of your graph: Where the code of the graph reads the comment “# change colour of groups” you can replace the HEX codes, # followed by 6-symbol code, with names of colours (e.g. blue, green…) or other HEX codes if you are familiar with them.\n8.     Save graph under new name: Add your initials to the file name under which the image is saved. Press Run. Your image should be visible in overall file hierarchy.\n \nDONE:\n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n*Exercise 3: Add another analysis step\nWe have shown you how to manipulate text and code in Jupyter notebooks. You should be able to add data visualisation (a graph) and stats for long-day light condition including annotations yourself.\n \n1.     Add additional cells including\na.     Titles\nb.     Edited code to depict graph from long-days (saved under different name)\nc.     Figure legend\nd.     Statistical testing of difference between genotypes on long-days (remember to assign a different variable throughout e.g. LD.aov)\ne.     Interpretation of results of statistical testing\n\nDONE:\n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n*Exercise 4: Sharing of your Jupyter Notebook\nYou have now generated your own analysis and interpretation on top of your collaborators results and want to share this with your colleagues.\n \n1.

If you want to compare the stage of your project a year ago from now, it only takes one command-line of code.\n*Experiment with changes: if you want to make changes in a script you can first make a “snapshot” of the project status before experimenting with changes.\n*Backup your work: by being able to link your local repository (folder) to a distant online host (GitHub), a version control system backs up your precious work instantly\n*Collaborate easily on projects: having a web-hosted synchronised version of your project will encourage collaboration with other researchers. Think about a colleague of yours being able to add a script to make a figure for your publication for instance. The repository will track their contribution and evidence their participation in the project\n \nDONE:\n\n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n*Semantic versioning quiz\nType +1 after the correct answer:\n\n*Which of the library version is the latest?\n*a) 0.12.4\n*b) 1.1.0\n*c) 1.12.3-alpha\n*d) 1.12.2\n*You use library fair.2.3.1 to automatically upload your data after analysis.

Select the notebook titled 'student_notebook_light_conditions.ipynb' and click 'Duplicate'.\n2.    Confirm with Duplicate when asked if you are certain that you want to duplicate the notebook.\n3.    A copy of the notebook has appeared with the suffix '-Copy' and a number. Explore the anatomy of the notebook (https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/fair-bio-practice/blob/gh-pages/fig/10-02-jupyter_anatomy.png)\n4.    Change the title of the notebook from -copy number to your initials e.g. “student_notebook_light_conditions_IB”\n5.    Save the notebook: Click on the disk symbol in the toolbar\n6.    Run the notebook: Select the top cell of the notebook with the title (this is likely pre-selected already and will show with a light-blue bar to its left), and click “Run” in the tool bar.\n7.    Click two times. What can you see?\n-\n-\n-\n-\n8.    We want to run ALL the code: In the top tool bar click Cell > Run All. What can you see?\n-\n-\n-\n-\n \n DONE: \n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n* Exercise 2: How to add and remove content\nYou have duplicated a notebook and saved it under your own name. Now we will add text, remove cells and change code.\n \n1.     Change the author name of the document to your name: Double click on the cell containing the author name and change the name.\n2.     Press Run again.\n3.     Add a new cell: Let us add details about the “light_results.txt” file that is loaded. The “+” in the tool bar creates new cells below the currently selected cell. Thus select the cell above the code and click “+” in the toolbar.\n4.     Ensure the type of the cell is Markdown and enter a description of subsequent analysis e.g.: “Loading of results following short- and long-day light exposure on arabidopsis, followed by visualisation of differences in chlorophyll/biomas etc... content between genotypes on short-days and long-days.”\n5.     Press Run again.\n6.     To remove a cell, select the cell you have just created and click on the scissors icon in the toolbar. (This can be undone under Edit > Undo Delete Cells)\n7.     Change colours of your graph: Where the code of the graph reads the comment “# change colour of groups” you can replace the HEX codes, # followed by 6-symbol code, with names of colours (e.g. blue, green…) or other HEX codes if you are familiar with them.\n8.     Save graph under new name: Add your initials to the file name under which the image is saved. Press Run. Your image should be visible in overall file hierarchy.\n \nDONE:\n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n*Exercise 3: Add another analysis step\nWe have shown you how to manipulate text and code in Jupyter notebooks. You should be able to add data visualisation (a graph) and stats for long-day light condition including annotations yourself.\n \n1.     Add additional cells including\na.     Titles\nb.     Edited code to depict graph from long-days (saved under different name)\nc.     Figure legend\nd.     Statistical testing of difference between genotypes on long-days (remember to assign a different variable throughout e.g. LD.aov)\ne.     Interpretation of results of statistical testing\n\nDONE:\n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n*Exercise 4: Sharing of your Jupyter Notebook\nYou have now generated your own analysis and interpretation on top of your collaborators results and want to share this with your colleagues.\n \n1.     Download your Notebook (ensure all code has been run) as .html and .pdf\n2.

If you want to compare the stage of your project a year ago from now, it only takes one command-line of code.\n*Experiment with changes: if you want to make changes in a script you can first make a “snapshot” of the project status before experimenting with changes.\n*Backup your work: by being able to link your local repository (folder) to a distant online host (GitHub), a version control system backs up your precious work instantly\n*Collaborate easily on projects: having a web-hosted synchronised version of your project will encourage collaboration with other researchers. Think about a colleague of yours being able to add a script to make a figure for your publication for instance. The repository will track their contribution and evidence their participation in the project\n \nDONE:\n\n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n*Semantic versioning quiz\nType +1 after the correct answer:\n\n*Which of the library version is the latest?\n*a) 0.12.4\n*b) 1.1.0\n*c) 1.12.3-alpha\n*d) 1.12.2\n*You use library fair.2.3.1 to automatically upload your data after analysis.

Select the notebook titled 'student_notebook_light_conditions.ipynb' and click 'Duplicate'.\n2.    Confirm with Duplicate when asked if you are certain that you want to duplicate the notebook.\n3.    A copy of the notebook has appeared with the suffix '-Copy' and a number. Explore the anatomy of the notebook (https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/fair-bio-practice/blob/gh-pages/fig/10-02-jupyter_anatomy.png)\n4.    Change the title of the notebook from -copy number to your initials e.g. “student_notebook_light_conditions_IB”\n5.    Save the notebook: Click on the disk symbol in the toolbar\n6.    Run the notebook: Select the top cell of the notebook with the title (this is likely pre-selected already and will show with a light-blue bar to its left), and click “Run” in the tool bar.\n7.    Click two times. What can you see?\n-\n-\n-\n-\n8.    We want to run ALL the code: In the top tool bar click Cell > Run All. What can you see?\n-\n-\n-\n-\n \n DONE: \n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n* Exercise 2: How to add and remove content\nYou have duplicated a notebook and saved it under your own name. Now we will add text, remove cells and change code.\n \n1.     Change the author name of the document to your name: Double click on the cell containing the author name and change the name.\n2.     Press Run again.\n3.     Add a new cell: Let us add details about the “light_results.txt” file that is loaded. The “+” in the tool bar creates new cells below the currently selected cell. Thus select the cell above the code and click “+” in the toolbar.\n4.     Ensure the type of the cell is Markdown and enter a description of subsequent analysis e.g.: “Loading of results following short- and long-day light exposure on arabidopsis, followed by visualisation of differences in chlorophyll/biomas etc... content between genotypes on short-days and long-days.”\n5.     Press Run again.\n6.     To remove a cell, select the cell you have just created and click on the scissors icon in the toolbar. (This can be undone under Edit > Undo Delete Cells)\n7.     Change colours of your graph: Where the code of the graph reads the comment “# change colour of groups” you can replace the HEX codes, # followed by 6-symbol code, with names of colours (e.g. blue, green…) or other HEX codes if you are familiar with them.\n8.     Save graph under new name: Add your initials to the file name under which the image is saved. Press Run. Your image should be visible in overall file hierarchy.\n \nDONE:\n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n*Exercise 3: Add another analysis step\nWe have shown you how to manipulate text and code in Jupyter notebooks. You should be able to add data visualisation (a graph) and stats for long-day light condition including annotations yourself.\n \n1.     Add additional cells including\na.     Titles\nb.     Edited code to depict graph from long-days (saved under different name)\nc.     Figure legend\nd.     Statistical testing of difference between genotypes on long-days (remember to assign a different variable throughout e.g. LD.aov)\ne.     Interpretation of results of statistical testing\n\nDONE:\n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n*Exercise 4: Sharing of your Jupyter Notebook\nYou have now generated your own analysis and interpretation on top of your collaborators results and want to share this with your colleagues.\n \n1.     Download your Notebook (ensure all code has been run) as .html and .pdf\n2.

If you want to compare the stage of your project a year ago from now, it only takes one command-line of code.\n*Experiment with changes: if you want to make changes in a script you can first make a “snapshot” of the project status before experimenting with changes.\n*Backup your work: by being able to link your local repository (folder) to a distant online host (GitHub), a version control system backs up your precious work instantly\n*Collaborate easily on projects: having a web-hosted synchronised version of your project will encourage collaboration with other researchers. Think about a colleague of yours being able to add a script to make a figure for your publication for instance. The repository will track their contribution and evidence their participation in the project\n \nDONE:\n\n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n*Semantic versioning quiz\nType +1 after the correct answer:\n\n*Which of the library version is the latest?\n*a) 0.12.4\n*b) 1.1.0\n*c) 1.12.3-alpha\n*d) 1.12.2\n*You use library fair.2.3.1 to automatically upload your data after analysis.

Select the notebook titled 'student_notebook_light_conditions.ipynb' and click 'Duplicate'.\n2.    Confirm with Duplicate when asked if you are certain that you want to duplicate the notebook.\n3.    A copy of the notebook has appeared with the suffix '-Copy' and a number. Explore the anatomy of the notebook (https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/fair-bio-practice/blob/gh-pages/fig/10-02-jupyter_anatomy.png)\n4.    Change the title of the notebook from -copy number to your initials e.g. “student_notebook_light_conditions_IB”\n5.    Save the notebook: Click on the disk symbol in the toolbar\n6.    Run the notebook: Select the top cell of the notebook with the title (this is likely pre-selected already and will show with a light-blue bar to its left), and click “Run” in the tool bar.\n7.    Click two times. What can you see?\n-\n-\n-\n-\n8.    We want to run ALL the code: In the top tool bar click Cell > Run All. What can you see?\n-\n-\n-\n-\n \n DONE: \n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n* Exercise 2: How to add and remove content\nYou have duplicated a notebook and saved it under your own name. Now we will add text, remove cells and change code.\n \n1.     Change the author name of the document to your name: Double click on the cell containing the author name and change the name.\n2.     Press Run again.\n3.     Add a new cell: Let us add details about the “light_results.txt” file that is loaded. The “+” in the tool bar creates new cells below the currently selected cell. Thus select the cell above the code and click “+” in the toolbar.\n4.     Ensure the type of the cell is Markdown and enter a description of subsequent analysis e.g.: “Loading of results following short- and long-day light exposure on arabidopsis, followed by visualisation of differences in chlorophyll/biomas etc... content between genotypes on short-days and long-days.”\n5.     Press Run again.\n6.     To remove a cell, select the cell you have just created and click on the scissors icon in the toolbar. (This can be undone under Edit > Undo Delete Cells)\n7.     Change colours of your graph: Where the code of the graph reads the comment “# change colour of groups” you can replace the HEX codes, # followed by 6-symbol code, with names of colours (e.g. blue, green…) or other HEX codes if you are familiar with them.\n8.     Save graph under new name: Add your initials to the file name under which the image is saved. Press Run. Your image should be visible in overall file hierarchy.\n \nDONE:\n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n*Exercise 3: Add another analysis step\nWe have shown you how to manipulate text and code in Jupyter notebooks. You should be able to add data visualisation (a graph) and stats for long-day light condition including annotations yourself.\n \n1.     Add additional cells including\na.     Titles\nb.     Edited code to depict graph from long-days (saved under different name)\nc.     Figure legend\nd.     Statistical testing of difference between genotypes on long-days (remember to assign a different variable throughout e.g. LD.aov)\ne.     Interpretation of results of statistical testing\n\nDONE:\n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n*Exercise 4: Sharing of your Jupyter Notebook\nYou have now generated your own analysis and interpretation on top of your collaborators results and want to share this with your colleagues.\n \n1.     Download your Notebook (ensure all code has been run) as .html and .pdf\n2.    View the documents and think about why it is important to run all code before download (try Cell > All Output > Clear and download your Notebook, compare the outputs)\n \nQuestions:\nWhat is the difference between running all code and clearing all run code?\n-\n-\n-\n \nWhy is it important to run all code before download?\n-\n-\n-\n \nDONE:\n\n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n*Exercise For Advanced\n\nFInd a way to plot in sensible way: both conditions LD and SD on the same graph, for the 3 genoty\n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n*Exercise 5: Accessibility of Jupyter Notebooks\nOn a scale from -2 to 2, how do you feel about the following statements (R is interchangeable with Python), \nwhere -2 (strongly disagree), 0 no opinion to +2 strongly agree:\n \nType a number between -2 to 2 behind the statement:\n*making graphs for a subset of data is easier in R than in Excel:\n*it is easier to filter for data in R than in Excel:\n*it is easier to generate a series of plots with similar layout in R than Excel:\n*it is easier to do large scale data processing in R than in Excel:\n*using notebooks does not require any programming knowledge:\n*notebooks give you a better overview of your data analysis than Excel:\n*notebooks links laboratory style records with data analysis\n*Jupyter is free, whilst a Microsoft Office (+Excel) suite costs $149.99, this alone is an incentive to use Jupyter:\n*you need to learn R to do any data processing in notebooks:\n*notebooks assures reproducible computing:\n\nDONE:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n*Lesson 11: Version Control\n\n*Exercise 1: Problems with a change\nWhich of these issues can you relate to? (Type +1 next to each statement if you relate to it)\n*I have fifteen versions of this file - which one do I use?\n*I can’t remake this figure from last year\n*I slightly modified my code in one place, everything stopped working\n*I have several copies of the same directory because I'm worried about breaking something\n*Somebody added erroneous records in a shared file with samples, cannot find who and why\n*You remember seeing a data file but cannot find it anymore: is it deleted? Moved away?\n*I tried multiple analysis and I don't remember which one I chose to generate my output data\n*I have to merge changes to our manuscript from 10 different emails with collaborators\n*I accidentally deleted a part of my work\n*I came to an old project and forgot where I left/saved it\n*I reorganized my data files, but broke the analysis pipeline and don't know how to fix it\n*I have trouble to find the source of a mistake in an experiment\n*My directory is polluted with a lot of unused/temporary/old folders because I'm afraid of losing something important\n*I made a lot of changes to my paper but want to bring back one paragraph\n \nDONE:\n\n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n*Exercise 2: Manual Versioning\nWhich of these issues does manual versioning help to tackle?\n(Type +1 next to each statement if manual versioning helps to tackle)\n \n*I have fifteen versions of this file and I don't know which one to use\n*I can't remake this figure from last year\n*I slightly modified my code in one place, everything stopped working\n*I have several copies of the same directory because I'm worried about breaking something\n*Somebody added erroneous records in a shared file with samples, I cannot find who and why\n*I tried multiple analysis and I don't remember which one I chose to generate my output data\n*I have to merge changes to our manuscript from 10 different emails from collaborators\n*I made a lot of changes to my paper but want to bring back one paragraph\n \nDONE:\n \n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n*Exercise 3: Changelog in action\nHave a look at one of the example Github repositories and how they track changes*:\n\nGreen and Blue:\n*data from E.R.

If you want to compare the stage of your project a year ago from now, it only takes one command-line of code\n\n*Experiment with changes: if you want to make changes in a script you can first make a “snapshot” of the project status before experimenting with changes.\n\n*Backup your work: by being able to link your local repository (folder) to a distant online host (GitHub), a version control system backs up your precious work instantly\n\n*Collaborate easily on projects: having a web-hosted synchronised version of your project will encourage collaboration with other researchers. Think about a colleague of yours being able to add a script to make a figure for your publication for instance. The repository will track their contribution and evidence their participation in the project\n \nDONE:\n\n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n*Semantic versioning quiz\nType +1 after the correct answer:\n\n*Which of the library version is the latest?\n*a) 0.12.4\n*b) 1.1.0\n*c) 1.12.3-alpha\n*d) 1.12.2\n*You use library fair.2.3.1 to automatically upload your data after analysis.

Pretend that you have a joined project that combines the outputs of both your papers/projects.\n\nWrite a short DMP for this joined project. Your DMP should contain the following three sections:\n1. What data will you acquire during the project: Please describe the type of data you will generate (for example ‘flow cytometry data’) as well as file formats and data volume. These data will be stored under (include the meta data as well).\n-\n-\n-\n\n2. How will you store the data: Please describe how you will store and organize your data, what metadata will you capture in what form. Explain how you will document the data during the duration of the project\n-\n-\n-\n\n3. How will you share the data: Please describe the strategies for data sharing, licensing and access information.\n-\n-\n-\n\nRemember: it is a joined project\n \n \n

Select the notebook titled 'student_notebook_light_conditions.ipynb' and click 'Duplicate'.\n2.    Confirm with Duplicate when asked if you are certain that you want to duplicate the notebook.\n3.    A copy of the notebook has appeared with the suffix '-Copy' and a number. Explore the anatomy of the notebook (https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/fair-bio-practice/blob/gh-pages/fig/10-02-jupyter_anatomy.png)\n4.    Change the title of the notebook from -copy number to your initials e.g. “student_notebook_light_conditions_IB”\n5.    Save the notebook: Click on the disk symbol in the toolbar\n6.    Run the notebook: Select the top cell of the notebook with the title (this is likely pre-selected already and will show with a light-blue bar to its left), and click “Run” in the tool bar.\n7.    Click two times. What can you see?\n-\n-\n-\n-\n8.    We want to run ALL the code: In the top tool bar click Cell > Run All. What can you see?\n-\n-\n-\n-\n \n DONE: \n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n* Exercise 2: How to add and remove content\nYou have duplicated a notebook and saved it under your own name. Now we will add text, remove cells and change code.\n \n1.     Change the author name of the document to your name: Double click on the cell containing the author name and change the name.\n2.     Press Run again.\n3.     Add a new cell: Let us add details about the “light_results.txt” file that is loaded. The “+” in the tool bar creates new cells below the currently selected cell. Thus select the cell above the code and click “+” in the toolbar.\n4.     Ensure the type of the cell is Markdown and enter a description of subsequent analysis e.g.: “Loading of results following short- and long-day light exposure on arabidopsis, followed by visualisation of differences in chlorophyll/biomas etc... content between genotypes on short-days and long-days.”\n5.     Press Run again.\n6.     To remove a cell, select the cell you have just created and click on the scissors icon in the toolbar. (This can be undone under Edit > Undo Delete Cells)\n7.     Change colours of your graph: Where the code of the graph reads the comment “# change colour of groups” you can replace the HEX codes, # followed by 6-symbol code, with names of colours (e.g. blue, green…) or other HEX codes if you are familiar with them.\n8.     Save graph under new name: Add your initials to the file name under which the image is saved. Press Run. Your image should be visible in overall file hierarchy.\n \nDONE:\n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n*Exercise 3: Add another analysis step\nWe have shown you how to manipulate text and code in Jupyter notebooks. You should be able to add data visualisation (a graph) and stats for long-day light condition including annotations yourself.\n \n1.     Add additional cells including\na.     Titles\nb.     Edited code to depict graph from long-days (saved under different name)\nc.     Figure legend\nd.     Statistical testing of difference between genotypes on long-days (remember to assign a different variable throughout e.g. LD.aov)\ne.     Interpretation of results of statistical testing\n\nDONE:\n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n*Exercise 4: Sharing of your Jupyter Notebook\nYou have now generated your own analysis and interpretation on top of your collaborators results and want to share this with your colleagues.\n \n1.     Download your Notebook (ensure all code has been run) as .html and .pdf\n2.    View the documents and think about why it is important to run all code before download (try Cell > All Output > Clear and download your Notebook, compare the outputs)\n \nQuestions:\nWhat is the difference between running all code and clearing all run code?\n-\n-\n-\n \nWhy is it important to run all code before download?\n-\n-\n-\n \nDONE:\n\n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n*Exercise For Advanced\n\nFInd a way to plot in sensible way: both conditions LD and SD on the same graph, for the 3 genotypes and two output variables (biomas, starch).\n\nIf you DONE type your name bellow t\n\nYou can try to create the same plots in python (but we cannot guarantee all the packages are installed)\n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n*Exercise 5: Accessibility of Jupyter Notebooks\nOn a scale from -2 to 2, how do you feel about the following statements (R is interchangeable with Python), \nwhere -2 (strongly disagree), 0 no opinion to +2 strongly agree:\n \nType a number between -2 to 2 behind the statement:\n*making graphs for a subset of data is easier in R than in Excel:\n*it is easier to filter for data in R than in Excel:\n*it is easier to generate a series of plots with similar layout in R than Excel:\n*it is easier to do large scale data processing in R than in Excel:\n*using notebooks does not require any programming knowledge:\n*notebooks give you a better overview of your data analysis than Excel:\n*notebooks links laboratory style records with data analysis\n*Jupyter is free, whilst a Microsoft Office (+Excel) suite costs $149.99, this alone is an incentive to use Jupyter:\n*you need to learn R to do any data processing in notebooks:\n*notebooks assures reproducible computing:\n\nDONE:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n*Lesson 11: Version Control\n\n*Exercise 1: Problems with a change\nWhich of these issues can you relate to? (Type +1 next to each statement if you relate to it)\n*I have fifteen versions of this file - which one do I use?\n*I can’t remake this figure from last year\n*I slightly modified my code in one place, everything stopped working\n*I have several copies of the same directory because I'm worried about breaking something\n*Somebody added erroneous records in a shared file with samples, cannot find who and why\n*You remember seeing a data file but cannot find it anymore: is it deleted? Moved away?\n*I tried multiple analysis and I don't remember which one I chose to generate my output data\n*I have to merge changes to our manuscript from 10 different emails with collaborators\n*I accidentally deleted a part of my work\n*I came to an old project and forgot where I left/saved it\n*I reorganized my data files, but broke the analysis pipeline and don't know how to fix it\n*I have trouble to find the source of a mistake in an experiment\n*My directory is polluted with a lot of unused/temporary/old folders because I'm afraid of losing something important\n*I made a lot of changes to my paper but want to bring back one paragraph\n \nDONE:\n\n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n*Exercise 2: Manual Versioning\nWhich of these issues does manual versioning help to tackle?\n(Type +1 next to each statement if manual versioning helps to tackle)\n \n*I have fifteen versions of this file and I don't know which one to use\n*I can't remake this figure from last year\n*I slightly modified my code in one place, everything stopped working\n*I have several copies of the same directory because I'm worried about breaking something\n*Somebody added erroneous records in a shared file with samples, I cannot find who and why\n*I tried multiple analysis and I don't remember which one I chose to generate my output data\n*I have to merge changes to our manuscript from 10 different emails from collaborators\n*I made a lot of changes to my paper but want to bring back one paragraph\n \nDONE:\n \n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n*Exercise 3: Changelog in action\nHave a look at one of the example Github repositories and how they track changes*:\n\nGreen and Blue:\n*data from E.R.

If you want to compare the stage of your project a year ago from now, it only takes one command-line of code\n\n*Experiment with changes: if you want to make changes in a script you can first make a “snapshot” of the project status before experimenting with changes.\n\n*Backup your work: by being able to link your local repository (folder) to a distant online host (GitHub), a version control system backs up your precious work instantly\n\n*Collaborate easily on projects: having a web-hosted synchronised version of your project will encourage collaboration with other researchers. Think about a colleague of yours being able to add a script to make a figure for your publication for instance. The repository will track their contribution and evidence their participation in the project\n \nDONE:\n\n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n*Semantic versioning quiz\nType +1 after the correct answer:\n\n*Which of the library version is the latest?\n*a) 0.12.4\n*b) 1.1.0\n*c) 1.12.3-alpha\n*d) 1.12.2\n*You use library fair.2.3.1 to automatically upload your data after analysis.
