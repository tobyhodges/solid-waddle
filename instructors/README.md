# Instructor notes

## General remarks

This course was run multiple times by us - the authors and at least once by an external group of teachers (who has not been trained by us).

We are fairly confident that this course "works" and the exercises have been valued as good or excellent.

This course was designed during COVID-19 pandemic for an online delivery.
We heavily depend on the online setting, ie. video call with breakout rooms, the ether pads for collaborative writing. 
We are not sure if this course in its current form would work in real-world workshop. For one there is will an significant overhead in starting group activities (people need to move around etc).
Unlike speaking up, the pads allows multiple student provide answers and suggestion in the same time. 

We delivered the training as 4 x 4 hours modules. The last day has at least one hour breathing space which we reserve for "project clinic" - discussing needs of individual projects 
and a short episode dedicated available resources at the UoE.
It means that there is possibility to add additional episode(s) or taking more time for the existing ones (for example to allow more time in the breakout rooms). 

The instructor folders contains the slide decks for the delivery, which works better than scrolling through carpentry website.
There are also set of word documents with content of the etherpad with the exercises for the student. 
They are bundled into "days". 

### Breakout rooms

Generally, students asked for more time in the group activities in their feedback forms. 
We typically give 5 minutes for the breakout rooms. While it may feel too short for an "active" group, it feels long for not so "engaged" one. So it is a balance. 
Also, we make sure to discuss the groups' answers so more time in the rooms will extend the episodes duration.

The groups should be about 5-7 participants if possible, that should guarantee sufficient level of engaged students in each group (despite our effort some students remain muted all the workshop).
We used zoom for the delivery and could see in the breakout room dialog who has muted mic and camera off and active speakers.
We tried to move participants between groups if one turned too particularly quiet.
We also send broadcast messages encouraging switiching mic etc.

### Etherpads

In our experience, students are more inclined to write down their answers, comments and suggestions than speaking up. So the "discussion" challenges are moved into the pad and we ask to write answers commenting on them.

For the True/False quizes, selecting correct answers we typically start talking over the exercise when we notice than first students are finishing the given exercise. 
It makes the course more dinamic, while we expect our audience accustomed to multitasking such as listening while completing a test.

The quiz like test (true/false, agree, select) are an excuse to comment on the answers. Always if there are some wrong answers, but, also to stress out the most important aspects of the topic.

For the end of episode quiz, we tend to ask students to complete them during the break and after the break comment only on "wrong" answers.

## Specifics for each episode

### 1. Welcome

You can start breakout rooms so students can introduce themselves in the groups.

### 2. Introduction to Open Science

When presenting Open Access explain what other "benefits" it brought with it (apart from costs free access). For example, the time save in trips to libraries or asking inter-libraries loans. 
That should act as an example for the 

Exercise 1. Benefits of openness

Here you should have at least two groups One for Open Data and one Open Software.
Comment on student answers, fill the gaps if some aspect are missing, for example publishing negative results for Open Data. Learning by example for Open Software.

Exercise 2. Personal benefits of being “open”

Answers will tend to cluster, you can comment on that. 
We talk about the typically overlooked: *"•	distinguish yourself from the crowd"*, as in the current "transition" period having those skills can still make a difference as all job/grants/fellowship competitors would have typically have good academic record. Open practices can be this one extra point.

The IP part can be skipped if the IP episode is planned on the same day.

### 3. Being FAIR

Exercise 1. Impossible ...

We give some teams a) the Impossible protocol and some b) the Imposible Average.
Those two work the best. 
We said that it is going to be a race who can get the answers first.
We warn there is no time to read the full manuscript, nor it is how we "typically look for data and protocols".

Sometimes there are answers to 1a. For the average in 5-7 minutes it is rather unlikely. 
We then explain what was the problem with 1a and demonstrate the problem with 1b. 
Show the tables with meaningless headers, say how to get the right column.
Then copy from from pdf to excel the table to show hot it gets scrambled.

That scrambling depends in what program the pdf was oppended. We recommend firefox or bing as they usually do not copy nicely (Acrobat does much better job). Foreing localales also can messad up with copying.

Exercise 2. FAIR Example

Typically some answers for I or R end up in A. 
You should do quick demo of the zenodo record and highlith the most important part (or point to them using the students answers)

Exercise 3. FAIR and You

We only once got the right answers. 
Always worth going back to Zenod and show: *Accessible - Trackable and countable*
as the views and downloads, mention the new metrics. 



### 4. IP and Openness

Exercise 1. Checking common licence:

Try to make it code-along exercise, clicking through the licence text and make the point (but give students the head start).

### 5. Intro to metadata

Use the life demo of omero records to show different kind of metadata rather than slides.

When talking about Minimal Inf, show the fairsharing.org collection.
Mention it is a good resource to find all the standards and repos for FAIR.

Exercise 3. What to include

Start by typing the title and the purpose.
you can ask people to think first of the C. elegans image and what should be added there, so start with domain specific ie microscopy, then go general.
You need to add the crucial metadata elements if student did not think about them, for example genotype, tissue type , generally sample description, some experimental conditions
