# Instructor notes

## General remarks

This course was run multiple times by us - the authors and at least once by an external group of teachers (who has not been trained by us).

We are fairly confident that this course "works" and the exercises have been valued as good or excellent.

This course was designed during COVID-19 pandemic for an online delivery.
We heavily depend on the online setting, ie. video call with breakout rooms, the ether pads for collaborative writing. 
We are not sure if this course in its current form would work in real-world workshop. For one there is will an significant overhead in starting group activities (people need to move around etc).
Unlike speaking up, the pads allows multiple student provide answers and suggestion in the same time. 

We delivered the training as 4 x 4 hours modules. The last day has at least one hour breathing space which we reserve for "project clinic" - discussing needs of individual projects 
and a short episode dedicated available resources at the UoE.
It means that there is possibility to add additional episode(s) or taking more time for the existing ones (for example to allow more time in the breakout rooms). 

The instructor folders contains the slide decks for the delivery, which works better than scrolling through carpentry website.
There are also set of word documents with content of the etherpad with the exercises for the student. 
They are bundled into "days". 

### Breakout rooms

Generally, students asked for more time in the group activities in their feedback forms. 
We typically give 5 minutes for the breakout rooms. While it may feel too short for an "active" group, it feels long for not so "engaged" one. So it is a balance. 
Also, we make sure to discuss the groups' answers so more time in the rooms will extend the episodes duration.

The groups should be about 5-7 participants if possible, that should guarantee sufficient level of engaged students in each group (despite our effort some students remain muted all the workshop).
We used zoom for the delivery and could see in the breakout room dialog who has muted mic and camera off and active speakers.
We tried to move participants between groups if one turned too particularly quiet.
We also send broadcast messages encouraging switiching mic etc.

### Etherpads

In our experience, students are more inclined to write down their answers, comments and suggestions than speaking up. So the "discussion" challenges are moved into the pad and we ask to write answers commenting on them.

For the True/False quizes, selecting correct answers we typically start talking over the exercise when we notice than first students are finishing the given exercise. 
It makes the course more dinamic, while we expect our audience accustomed to multitasking such as listening while completing a test.

The quiz like test (true/false, agree, select) are an excuse to comment on the answers. Always if there are some wrong answers, but, also to stress out the most important aspects of the topic.

For the end of episode quiz, we tend to ask students to complete them during the break and after the break comment only on "wrong" answers.
