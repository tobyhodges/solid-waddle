# Feedback on the first "Fair in biological practices" course, run 19th-22th October 2021

[Public page for workshop is here](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/fair-bio-practice)

## Ines's verdict

This course covering FAIR and Open Research practices for biological sciences stretched across four afternoons (4 1/2h - 5h each afternoon) and was received very well among the audience. The fantastic feedback received, summarised below, reflects the efforts of the whole team involved in putting together and hosting the first run of the course.

Based on suggestions from users and discussions with the tutors and helpers, here is our general feedback, and some personal suggestions on what should be changed in the future.

* the exercises worked well and students were generally engaged
* however, some students likely prefer to type their opinions and thoughts as oppose to speak up
* the speed was unanimously good
* 10min breaks after each episode to allow for enough time to get away from the screen
* the introduction to the online delivery was slow (20min) and should be streamlined next time to keep people engaged
* currently this course is focused on University of Edinburgh students, with the last session covering resources at UoE - half an hour parallel session on topics like reproducible computing, collaboration and anonymisation are considered once this course go beyond UoE attendees


## Verbatim comments

### Day 1 - Intro to FAIR and Good enough practices

**What did you like:**

 * Well rounded consideration of open science
 * Very clear slides
 * Good links to available resources
 * Fair and balanced, areas which were personal opinion were made clear
 * The pad was great - motivated participants to answer and get involved
 * engaging delivery
 * great examples (conversion from PDF to excel was a great exemplar of where things go wrong!)
 * Mix of lexture context and exercises was really balanced
 * Explanation of FAIR
 * The exercises in groups
 * Very interactive
 * Keep you busy and not boring
 * The collaborative pad is amazing!
 * Did not expect to earn anything new regarding bash. I was plesantly suprised.
 * Information about metadata

**What can we improve:**

 * The overall course structure was really clear (the theme for each day) 
but I couldn’t see a clear structure within each day? Something early on 
would have helped to manage expectations (learning objectives/key points 
etc.).
* Similarly it wasn’t so clear when to expect breaks (and 9 minutes with 
an exercise to do isn’t really long enough to get away from the screen)
* Participation in my break out group was very poor. Only two people 
really participating, 3 had their cameras off and said nothing. We all 
have to deal with this (I certainly have!) but I wondered if 5 mins 
extra in the first group and time for introductions may have helped? Or 
an exercise where each person has to say something?
* A couple of times some of the most contentious 
issues (like whether data sharing can lead to scooping) were navigated without 
discussing the pros and cons. Some people will have potentially 
valid concerns and they could be used to structure some discussion?
 * Slides with answers after each exercise
 * Allow time for breakout groups to introduce each other to establish trust, context etc
 * More time for breakout group exercises
 * Not so many interactive things happening simultaneously
 * Introducing the participants
 * An extra break
 * Four hours looking at a screen feels longer than I thought

*Note:*  As per request, for subsequent days breaks were included after each episode.


### Day 2 - Metadata, resuable record keeping and folder organisation

**What did you like:**

 * The tempo helps keep me focused on the topics
 * I do use protocols io and benchling, but this lesson really encouraged me to use it more
 * It was great that lots of resources and softwares were mentioned
 * gave many examples
 * good examples and logic for file naming...something I have struggled with in the past
 * Learned about new resources I wasn't aware of
 * Learned ways to improve my current system
 * I know about the digital laboratory notebook for the first time and considered introducing it to my laboratory

**What can we improve:**

 * a list of the resources mentioned (OpenRefine, Antname?, etc)
 * Data transfer (which is part of data management)? secure sharing of data? 

### Day 3 + 4 - Repositories, reusable data analysis and templates; Version control and DMPs

**What did you like:**

 * Explanation of the jupyter notebooks was very helpful. It's something I would like to start using for all my  analyses to help my PI and anyone else understand what I'm doing. I had read about them but thought they were complicated...this helped illustrate how easy and powerful they are to use
 * Seeing how people who work in different disciplines work

**If the lesson could be 5 minutes longer, what would you add or spend more time on:**

 * The good, The bad and the ugly of coding practices
 * Ontologies
 * Re-using other people's code
 
 ### Students future journey to be FAIRproductive
 
 * For each paper I publish  I will make a Zenodo deposit with all the data files
 * I'm going to take a very deep breath and make a lot of changes starting with using GitHub for all code instead of using folders
 * Proactively think about how reusable and sharable my code is. Don't just think about myself.
 * Start using ELN
 * Write data management plan for my PhD
 * Reorganise my folder structure
 * Finally make a personalised commit message template
 * Attempt to start using an ELN. Review and restructure current data storage and add read me files.
 * Write protocols on protocols.io
 * Back up my data at three different locations
 * will practice to make a data management plan
 * Proactively think about data storage and sharing as I'm generating data
 * Think about how the structure of data management in general.
 * Stop putting the date at the beginning of all my filenames
 * I will never put the date at the beginning of any folders
 * I'd like to use Jupyter notebooks for R code because it makes it very easy to describe my work using RMarkdown.  But in the meantime I'm going to start using RMarkdown using RStudio instead of just writing R code and descriptions in separate folders
 * Write more metadata for others to understand my work
 * Think as a user of my data instead of just a creator
 * Create templates for code I have written over the last year
