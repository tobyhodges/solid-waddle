### Shania T. Wain (she/her) - senior postdoc 
Shania is a senior systems biology postdoc, so she is trained in both experimental and theoretical work. 
She is very skilled at the bench, she routinary creates new transgenic constructs and tests them with molecular biology techniques. 
She has a keen interest in bioinformatics and computational modelling. She can easily write and debug Python and R scripts to analyse, 
model and visualise her (and her teammates) data. She has heard about the concepts of Open Science, FAIR principles but has never applied them to her projects before.  

She wants her work to have the highest impact possible to improve her chances in obtaining an independent position. 
She is annoyed how much time she spends bouncing emails with data and results files every time a group member needs her to reanalyse data. 
She believes her gene expression datasets could be used for machine learning, but she has no time to learn it herself.  

This workshop will teach her how adopting Open Science and FAIR practices will boost her academic visibility. 
She will learn how data management practices can save her time when collaborating within her group and enable others to reanalyse their own data.  

### Guillermo Puertas (he/him) - lab manager 
Guillermo is a lab manager. He makes sure the lab is running smoothly and no reagents are ever missing. 
He helps with budgets, project management, organizes lab meetings, oversees lab training and is (occasionally) involved with doing experiments 
especially protocols optimisation. He has no programming skills but has extensive expertise with office and data analysis software,
and online database searches.  

He finds it challenging to be on top of the constant flow of new student and postdocs projects,
and how much time he spends in handing over projects to new students. His biggest nuisance is reviving of
old projects and chasing both datasets and samples. Sometimes he feels frustrated that he cannot get independent credit
for all his work as he always must wait to be included as a co-author of publication. 

This workshop will help him learn efficient ways to organize a lab project from start to finish by 
implementing FAIR principles into the research data cycle. He will learn how to effectively manage protocols
and get the credit by sharing them. He will learn how to standardize data descriptions in the lab. 

### Kavindra Anand (they/them) - junior postdocs 
Kavindra are starting their first postdoctoral stay. 
They have recently obtained a PhD in Plant Biology and are very skilled in running plant molecular and physiology experiments. 
They recently published their first publication, but they found the process of preparing all 
the figures and required information for the publisher as super tedious and time consuming. As postdocs, 
they must find an effective way to organise their own research project and the PhD students they are going to supervise. 

They are interested in being able to share their ongoing research notes with other lab members. 
They have never heard the acronym FAIR before, and the word metadata currently scares them. 

This workshop will teach them why data management is important for research and how it can help them save time and become more efficient. 
They will understand how they can benefit from Open Science and FAIR principles. 
They will learn about how to use electronic lab notebooks (ELNs) to share experimental notes with other lab members, how to find suitable repositories for their data and how to describe the data in a standard way. And... they will stop fearing metadata!
