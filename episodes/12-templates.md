## What are Templates

Templates are documents with a pre-determined layout and style which allow for reproducibility
of new documents based on the same layout/pattern/style/guidelines. For example a useful
template are label templates that contain all necessary experimental information. Thinking back
to our arabidopsis experiment, a tube label template for an experiment could contain: date,
genotype, if short- or light-day.

## Benefits of Templates

Use of such templates is incredibly convenient. If we were to print labels for tubes, using a
template we could print an entire batch at once instead of having to do it label by label or
hand write each individual one. Overall templates:

- save time
- enforce best practices (e.g. naming standards, using PIDs)
- provide guidelines for other users of the template
- assure consistency across sample collection, experiments, and data analysis
- allow automatisation of searching/processing/analysis
- ensure reproducibility! (FAIR)

## Types of templates

Templates could be anything with a pre-determined layout and purpose to be used for **repeating activities**. For example templates could be:

- in an ELN for different experiment types (e.g. Benchling)
- for sample recording and registration (e.g. in Clinical Trial Management)
- for project structure
- for a readme file
- for a data management plan

## Exercise 1: Your template (30 min at end of day + 15 min next day discussing templates)

Write your own group template for either

- a measurement (PCR on robot etc...)
- experiment (e.g. gene levels in response to stress)

In Excel or as a Document (txt/word) or Benchling (if you fancy using it!),
also provide some example data.

Think about:

- what you will need as the producer
- what you will need as the consumer
- how you could limit the values (controlled vocabularies)
- what PID or ontology terms you could use to annotate

Drop the templates into the folder shared on the Notepad.
Make sure to exchange emails in case Zoom dies.
