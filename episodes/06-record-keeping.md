Good scientific practice includes good record keeping, which ensures not only transparency and reproducibility, but also accountability. One prime example of why this is necessary is the recent data scandal surrounding [Novartis' FDA approval](https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/novartis-gene-therapy-application-contained-manipulated-data-fda-says/560346/) for their gene therapy Zolgensma, a treatment for the fatal childhood motor neuron disease Spinal Muscular Atrophy. Novartis applied with manipulated data for FDA approval, however withheld data which would have delayed FDA approval of the drug. Whilst clinical trial data show a benefit of the drug, unexplained discrepancies in mouse data and allegations of data mismanagement were not reported until a week before FDA approval.

In order to avoid data mismanagement and such unexplained discrepancies, it is imperative to keep dated, accurate, complete and understandable records of our experiments. This means they should include enough detail for others to reproduce under ideally the same conditions. You are, legally (!!) the one responsible for your records, not your colleague, not your PI.

In the following exercise we want to demonstrate how to keep good quality records, and some of the benefits that new repositories such as electronic lab notebooks (ELNs) or online protocols have. There are multiple repo's for ELNs and online protocols, here we will discuss free options that are easy to use: [Benchling](https://www.benchling.com/) and  [procols.io](https://www.protocols.io/welcome)
