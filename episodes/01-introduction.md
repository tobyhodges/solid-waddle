TODO: Some nice short opening, something in the spirit:
Open Science is transforming how we do research and communicated within
biological community and the whole society.

Hello everyone, and welcome to **FAIR in biological practice** workshop.
We are very pleased to have you with us.

> ## Today's Trainers
>
> To begin class, each Trainer should give a brief introduction of themselves.
>
{: .discussion}

Now we would like to get to know all of you.

> ## Who are you and what are your expectations from the workshop
>
> Please introduce yourself shortly and tell us:
>
> * Why are you taking this course?
> * What goals do you have for the follwing days?

TODO Open Science movement, what it is, why, when, who is behind,

TODO short description of each part of OS

> ## Goals of Open Science
>
> For the following OS parts:
> * Open Access
> * Open Data
> * Open Software
> * Open Notebooks
> * Open Peer Review
>
> discuss what are the main goals or problems that are being addressed
> by those Open initiatives.
>
> For example:
> Open educational resources:
> - makes quality teaching materials widely available
> - permits collaborative development of courses
> - improves teachers/instructors skills by sharing ideas
>
> *The Trainer may have you discuss in small groups one initiative each and
> then gather your thoughts together as a group.*

>> ## Solution
>>
>> TODO: We should provide some answers for each of 5 here as a take away.
>> **Open Access**
>> * free, unlimited access to scientific discovery
>> * speeds knowledge distribution
>>
>> **Open Data**
>> * one
>> * two
>>
>> **Open Software**
>> * one
>> * two
>>
>> **Open Notebooks**
>> * one
>> * two

>> **Open Peer Review**
>> * one

> Discuss in group how you personally can benefit from making your data or source code open.

TODO: Describe that OA is very popular cause the UK funders require so,
that it changed the publishing world with OA journals, new bussiness models.
But for many publishers as the minimum you can deposit golden copy at your institution
which fulfuls UK requirements.

TODO: One paragraph on O Software. That is very popular, becomes rather default
than option, that bussiness is on board. Collaborations, bug fixes, transparency,
developers portfolio.

> ## Benefits of Open Science
>
> TODO: List the benefits, those should come in the discussion above,
> but as the lesson must be "self taught" lets state them here. And
> as a seprate box not a solution so a) no cheating b) it is nicely visible
> for those who read quickly through the lesson.
{: .callout}

>
> -- I propose the costs of open data or software to move after FAIR
> and metadata so the involved work is more obvious
>

> ## Why we are not doing Open Science already
>
> Discuss why you did not or would not make your data or software open.

TODO: Describe the barriers and risks of OS movement:
- IP
- sensitive data
- misuse (fake news)
- the costs in $ and in time

>## Open Science Quizz

> Which of the following statements about the OS movement are true/false?
>
>* Open Science relies strongly on the Internet
>* Open Access eliminates publishing costs
>* You cannot Open Source patented software
>* You cannot charge for Open Source software
>* Open Data facilitates re-use
>* Open Data increases confidence in research findings
>* In Open Peer Review, readers vote on publication acceptance
>* Open Notebooks improve reproducibility
>* Open Notebooks can create patenting issues
>* Open Access permits the whole society to benefit from scientific findings
>* Posting your Excel files on the group webpage is in the spirit of Open Data
>* Citizen Science engages public in the research process
