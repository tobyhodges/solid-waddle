Show domain specific vs general 
(e.g. this omero based showcase datasets vs images in zenodo/fig share)
(or biodare vs zenodo/fig)
Both have problem that not having dois, or maybe the omero one has.
Faridom hub vs zenodo. Fairdom hub can run model simulations! And has project structures
maybe good to show

Recommend the most obvious repos.

Teach how to find a repo, that best way is to start with lists from publishers and funders,

Fairsharing, shows toooooo many. How to choose then, what criteria to use (standards, funding)

Finding repo first may help in deciding what metdata to collect and how.
