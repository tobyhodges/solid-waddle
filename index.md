FIXME: Open Science is disruptive, will change how we do reasearch and how society benefits from it. Making data re-usable is one of the key components and FAIR principles are a way to achieve it.
But what does it mean in pracice, how biologist can actually incorporapte those principles in their workflow. That FAIR and OS is a process. That at current world you can be FAIR ready rather than FAIR from the beginign. By right planning and tools you can then easily make your outputs publically reusable.

We will teach you that.

Then the prequesities/user desc by Andrew. 
What to expect what not to expect from the course.
