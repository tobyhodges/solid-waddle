> ## Prerequisites
>
> This lesson guides you through concepts and tools used in Open Science, FAIR principles and data management (and how to apply them to your day-to-day research).
> If you are are interested in applying these concepts in your daily research life, this lesson is for you!
> 
> There may be additional prerequisites for individual episodes/lessons in the extras section.

## Introduction
Open Science is disruptive. It will change how we do reasearch and how society benefits from it. Making data re-usable is key to this, and FAIR principles are a way to achieve it.
* But what does it mean in practice?
* How can a biologist incorporate those principles in their workflow?
* We will learn that becoming FAIR and following OS practices is a process.

We will teach you how planning and using the correct set of tools you can make your outputs ready for public sharing and reuse. 

## General Information 
The course is aimed at non-PI researchers in biomedicine science (PhD students, postdocs, technicians, etc.) who are interested in Open Science, FAIR principles and data management. This training is aimed at those who want to become acquainted with these concepts and apply them throughout their projectâ€™s life cycle. 

You don't need to have any prior knowledge of data managmet or any programming skills to attend this workshop, but you do need to be willing and committed to improving your data management techniques and to learn how to follow FAIR guidelines.   

This hands-on two-day workshop covers the basics of Open Science and FAIR practices, and looks at how to use these ideas in your own projects.   
The workshop is a mix of lectures and hands-on lessons where you will use the approaches learned and implement some of the discussed practices.

> ## Learning Objectives
>
> After following this lesson, learners will:
>
> * be familiar with the concept of Open Science and Open Research. 
> * be familiar with FAIR guidelines. 
> * understand the FAIR data research data cycle. 
> * be familiar with tools that allow you to implement a FAIR research data cycle. 
> * understand the importance of metadata. 
> * understand how implementing these concepts at the beginning of a project will help you save time towards the end of the project cycle.
