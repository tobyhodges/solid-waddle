## Introduction
Open Science is disruptive. It will change how we do reasearch and how society benefits from it. Making data re-usable is key to this, and FAIR principles are a way to achieve it.
* But what does it mean in practice?</li>
* How can a biologist incorporapte those principles in their workflow?
* We will learn that becoming FAIR and following OS practices is a process.

Nowadays you can be FAIR ready rather than FAIR from the beginning. Through planning and using the correct set of tools you can easily make your outputs public and reusable.

## General Information 
The course is aimed at non-PI researchers (PhD students, postdocs, technicians, etc.) who are interested in Open Science, FAIR principles and data management. This training is aimed at those who want to become acquainted with these concepts and apply them throughout a projectâ€™s life cycle. You don't currently need to have any prior knowledge or any programming skills to attend this workshop, but you do need to be willing and committed to improving your data management techniques and to learn how to follow FAIR guidelines.   
Software Carpentry, Data Carpentry, and Library Carpentry's mission is to help scientists, researchers, and librarians get more research done in less time and with less pain by teaching them basic lab skills for scientific computing. This hands-on two-day workshop covers the basics of Open Science and FAIR practices, and looks at how to use these ideas in your own projects.   
The workshop is a mix of lectures and hands-on lessons where you will use the approaches learned and implement some of the discussed practices. 

## Learning Outcomes 
After taking this workshop you should: 
* be familiar with the concept of Open Science and Open Research. 
* be familiar with FAIR guidelines. 
* understand the FAIR data research data cycle. 
* be familiar with tools that allow you to implement a FAIR research data cycle. 
* understand the importance of metadata. 
* understand how implementing these concepts at the beginning of a project will help you save time towards the end of the project cycle. 

## Workshop location 
This is an online event. We will meet using the online videoconference software Zoom. You will need to download and install the latest Zoom client to connect with your instructors. The link to use for this event will be announced via email to registered participants. Remember to update your client before the start of the course.
