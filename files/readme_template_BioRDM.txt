[Instructions in this document are in between brackets.]
[This template has been designed with the goal of documenting datasets that are made publicly available in a repository, but it can be adapted to working datasets.]
[Dates in this document should use the format YYYY-MM-DD.]
[Scholarly outputs cited in this document should follow a consistent style (e.g. APA style)]
[When you are done filling this template delete all instructions and delete any sections or questions that do not apply to your dataset.]
[All of the items in this template are optional, but fill it as thoroughly as possible to ensure the reusability of your dataset.]
[You may create more than one readme file in your dataset, if appropriate (e.g. one for your tabular data, one for your code)]
[This template was created by the BioRDM Team of the University of Edinburgh (UK) by modifying the readme template from the Research Data Services at Oregon State University, which can be found at https://guides.library.oregonstate.edu/ld.php?content_id=45294345. This template was in turn generated by modifying and expanding the University of Minnesota Libraries readme template that can be found in z.umn.edu/readme]

CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION
1. Abstract for the dataset 
[The abstract should describe the dataset, not the research or the results obtained after analyzing the dataset. The dataset abstract should be different than an article or book abstract, even if the dataset is tightly related to the article or book.]

2. Date range of data collection:
[single date or range or approximate date in format YYYY-MM-DD]

3. Funding sources that supported the collection of the data:
[Include agency and grant number if applicable]


ACCESS INFORMATION

1. Licenses/restrictions placed on the data:
[E.g. This work is licensed under a Creative Commons No Rights Reserved (CC0) license; E.g. This work is on the Public Domain; E.g. This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License]

2. Links to publications related to the dataset:
[If there is a publication that uses or cites the data that has not been approved yet, include it here anyway, with as much information as you have at the moment (e.g. authors and title). If the publications have been published include the DOI in the citation. ]

3. Links to other publicly accessible locations of the data:

4. Recommended citation for the data:
[Doe, J. & Smith, J. (2018) Title of this wonderful dataset [Data set]. Oregon State University. https://doi.org/10.7267/doid01DOI ]

5. Dataset Digital Object Identifier (DOI)
[Information to add at the end of the submission process, after dataset review.]

6. Limitations to reuse
[Describe any known problems or caveats that would limit reuse of the data.]


METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION
[Describe the methodology used to generate the dataset]
[Include links or references to publications or other documentation containing methodological information]
[Do not copy paste the methods section from a pending publication unless you have made sure that you can do that. Some journals may consider this as a publication, and will not accept a manuscript with a section that has already been published.]
[If you want to refer to an article that has not been accepted for publication yet, include as much information as you have at the moment (e.g. authors and title). If the publication has been published include the DOI in the citation. If the publication does not have a DOI (like a dissertation) include a URL.]

1. Description of methods used for collection/generation of data: 
[experimental design or protocols used in data collection]

2. Methods for processing the data: 
[describe how the submitted data were generated from the raw or collected data]

3. Instrument- or software-specific information needed to interpret the data:
[If software is needed to interpret the data, explain where to get the software. If software is not openly available include it in the dataset (if possible). If including the software is not possible consider changing the format of the dataset. Include version of software. ]

4. Standards and calibration information, if appropriate:

5. Environmental/experimental conditions:
[e.g., cloud cover, atmospheric influences, computational environment, etc.]

6. Describe any quality-assurance procedures performed on the data:

7. People involved with sample collection, processing, analysis and/or submission:
[If they are not include as collaborators, or if you want to describe more carefully who did what.]


DATASET FOLDER/FILE OVERVIEW
[All folders/files in the dataset should be listed here. If a file naming schema is used, it is fine to explain it instead of listing all the files. Include directory structure if necessary.]
[Filenames should include extension.]

1. Folder/File List
   A. Folder/File name:        
      Short description:        

2. Relationship between folders/files:

3. Formats
[List all the formats present in this dataset. Include explanations or instructions if necessary (e.g. links to page describing a metadata standard)]        


OTHER 
[Include any other important information about the data that you did not have opportunity to discuss anywhere in this template]
