## General information

This lesson provides foundation for practical incorporation of Open Science and FAIR data principles into biological data managment.

FIXME: Add description what this project is about.
Why we develop the lesson (? copy paste something from the grant application), ? funding info?

That there is a gap in knowledge of how to apply FAIR pricinples in real biological work. Especially for the wet-people. 

So a bit different angle than lesson description, what is the rationale behind.

Overall goals: 
?Teach how to be FAIR in practice
?How to organize research workflows that then it is easy to be Open and Reusable.
